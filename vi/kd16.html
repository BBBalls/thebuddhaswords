<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>At one time the Awakened One, the Lord was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove at the squirrels’ feeding place. Now at that time lodgings had not been permitted to monks by the Lord. So these monks stayed here and there: in a forest, at the root of a tree, on a hillside, in a glen, in a mountain cave, in a cemetery, in a forest glade, in the open air, on a heap of straw. Early in the mornings these went out from this and that place: from the forest … from the heap of straw, pleasing when approaching and when receding, when looking before, when looking back, when bending back (their arms), when stretching them out, their eyes cast down and possessed of pleasant behaviour.</p>

<p>Now at that time a (great) merchant of Rājagaha went early one morning to a pleasure grove. The (great) merchant of Rājagaha saw these monks going out from this and that place: from a forest … from a heap of straw, and seeing them he made up his mind. Then the (great) merchant of Rājagaha approached those monks; having approached, he spoke thus to those monks: "If I, revered sirs, were to have dwelling-places built, would you stay in my dwelling-places?"</p>

<hr>
<p>"Householder, dwelling-places have not been allowed by the Lord."</p>

<p>"Well then, revered sirs, having inquired of the Lord, tell me (what he says)."</p>

<p>"Very well, householder," and these monks, having answered the (great) merchant of Rājagaha in assent, approached the Lord; having approached the Lord, having greeted him, they sat down at a respectful distance. As they were sitting down at a respectful distance, these monks spoke thus to the Lord: "Lord, the (great) merchant of Rājagaha is anxious to have dwelling-places built. What line of conduct should be followed by us, Lord?" Then the Lord on this occasion having given reasoned talk addressed the monks, saying:</p>

<p>"I allow, monks, five (kinds of) abodes: a dwelling-place, a curved house, a long house, a mansion, a cave."</p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>Then these monks approached the (great) merchant of Rājagaha; having approached, they spoke thus to the (great) merchant of Rājagaha: "Householder, dwelling-places have been allowed by the Lord. Do now what seems right." Then the (great) merchant of Rājagaha had sixty dwelling-places established on one day alone. When the (great) merchant of Rājagaha had had these sixty dwelling-places finished he approached the Lord; having approached, having greeted the Lord, he sat down at a respectful distance. As he was sitting down at a respectful distance, the (great) merchant of Rājagaha spoke thus to the Lord: "Lord, may the Lord consent to a meal with me on the morrow together with the Order of monks." The Lord consented by becoming silent. Then the (great) merchant of Rājagaha, having understood the Lord’s consent, rising from his seat departed keeping his right side towards him.</p>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>Then the (great) merchant of Rājagaha, having had sumptuous foods, solid and soft, prepared towards the end of that night, had the time announced to the Lord, saying: "It is time, Lord, the meal is ready." Then the Lord, having dressed in the morning, taking his bowl and robe, approached the dwelling of the (great) merchant of Rājagaha; having approached, he sat down on the appointed seat together with the Order of monks. Then the (great) merchant of Rājagaha, having with his own hand served and satisfied the Order of monks with the Awakened One at its head with sumptuous foods, solid and soft, sat down at a respectful distance when the Lord had eaten and had withdrawn his hand from his bowl. As he was sitting down at a respectful distance the (great) merchant of Rājagaha spoke thus to the Lord: "Lord, I had these sixty dwelling-places built because I need merit, because I need heaven. What line of conduct am I, Lord, to follow in regard to these dwelling-places?"</p>

<p>"Well now, do you, householder, establish these sixty dwelling-places for (the use of) the Order of the four quarters, present and to come."</p>

<p>"Very well, Lord," and the (great) merchant of Rājagaha, having answered the Lord in assent, had those sixty dwelling-places established for (the use of) the Order of the four quarters, present and to come.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>Then the Lord thanked the (great) merchant of Rājagaha in these verses:</p>

<p id="p5" class="verse"><span class="parno">5</span>"They ward off cold and heat and beasts of prey from there
<br>And creeping things and gnats and rains in the wet season.</p>

<p id="p6" class="verse"><span class="parno">6</span>When the dreaded hot wind arises, that is warded off.
<br>To meditate and obtain insight in a refuge and at ease: — </p>

<p id="p7" class="verse"><span class="parno">7</span>"A dwelling-place is praised by the Awakened One as chief gift to an Order.
<br>Therefore a wise man, looking to his own weal,</p>

<p id="p8" class="verse"><span class="parno">8</span>Should have charming dwelling-places built
<br>so that those who have heard much can stay therein.
<br>"To these food and drink, raiment and lodgings</p>

<p id="p9" class="verse"><span class="parno">9</span>He should give, to the upright, with mind purified.
<br>(Then) these teach him dhamma dispelling every ill;
<br>He, knowing that dhamma, here attains nibbāna, canker-
less."</p>

<p id="p10"><span class="parno">10</span>Then the Lord, having given thanks to the (great) merchant of Rājagaha in these verses, rising from his seat, departed.</p>

<p id="p11"><span class="parno">11</span>People heard: "It is said that dwelling-places are allowed by the Lord," and they zealously had dwelling-places built. These dwelling-places did not have doors, and snakes, scorpions and centipedes got in. They told this matter to the Lord.

 He said: "<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, a door.</span>" Having made a hole in the wall, they tied on the door with jungle creeper and with cord, but these were eaten by rats and white ants and when the tyings were eaten the doors fell down. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: "<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, a doorpost and lintel, a hollow like a mortar (for the door to revolve in) a small upper projection.</span>" The doors did not meet. "<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, a hole for pulling through (the cord), cord for pulling through.</span>" The doors could not be closed. "<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, a post for the bolt, a ‘monkey’s head,’ a pin (to secure the bolt), a stick (used as a bolt).</span>"</p>

<p id="p12"><span class="parno">12</span>Now at that time monks were not able to open a door. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: "<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, a keyhole and three (kinds of) keys: a copper key, a wooden key, a horn key.</span>" But the dwelling-places were unguarded when those who, having unfastened (the doors), entered. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: "<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, a bolt and a pin (to secure the bolt).</span>"</p>

<p id="p13"><span class="parno">13</span>Now at that time dwelling-places were roofed with grass; they were cold in the cold weather, hot in the hot weather. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: "<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, having lashed on (a roofing), to give it a smearing inside and out.</span>"</p>

<p id="p14"><span class="parno">14</span>Now at that time dwelling-places had no windows. They were bad for the eyes and nasty smelling. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: "<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, three (kinds of) windows: a railing window, a lattice window, a stick window.</span>" Squirrels and bats got through the spaces in the windows. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: "<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, drapery across the windows.</span>" Squirrels and bats got in even through the drapery. "<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, shutters across the windows, little bolsters across the windows.</span>"</p>

<p id="p15"><span class="parno">15</span>Now at that time monks lay down to sleep on the ground and their limbs and robes were soiled with dust. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: "<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, a grass matting.</span>" The grass matting was eaten by rats and white ants. "<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, a solid bench.</span>" Because of the solid bench their limbs became painful. "<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, a little couch of split bamboo.</span>"</p>

<h4>&nbsp;</h4>

<p><span class="parno">16–19</span>Now at that time a bierlike long couch accrued to an Order. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: "<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, a long couch.</span>" A long chair accrued. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: "<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, a long chair.</span>" Now at that time a bierlike couch with slats accrued to an Order … a chair with slats … a bierlike couch with curved legs … a chair with curved legs … a bierlike couch with removeable legs … a chair with removeable legs accrued. "<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, a chair with removeable legs.</span>"</p>

<hr>
<p id="p20"><span class="parno">20</span>Now at that time a rectangular chair accrued to an Order. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: "<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, a rectangular chair.</span>" A tall rectangular chair accrued. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: "<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, even a tall rectangular chair.</span>" A three-sided (couch) accrued. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: "<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, a three-sided (couch).</span>" A tall three-sided (couch) accrued. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: "<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, even a tall three-sided (couch).</span>" A plaited chair accrued … a cloth chair … a sheep-footed chair … a "stalks of the emblic myrobalan" chair … a wooden (chair) … a stool … a straw chair accrued to an Order. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: "<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, a straw chair.</span>"</p>

<hr>
<p id="p21"><span class="parno">21</span>Now at that time the group of six monks lay down to sleep on high couches. People touring the lodgings, having seen them … spread it about, saying: "Like householders who enjoy pleasures of the senses." They told this matter to the Lord. He said: "<span class="rule">Monks, you should not lie down to sleep on high couches. Whoever should (so) lie down to sleep, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span>"</p>

<p id="p22"><span class="parno">22</span>Now at that time a certain monk, lying down to sleep on a low couch, was bitten by a snake. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: "<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, supports for the couches.</span>"</p>

<p id="p23"><span class="parno">23</span>Now at that time the group of six monks used tall supports for the couches; they rocked to and fro together with the tall supports for the couches. "<span class="rule">Monks, tall supports for couches should not be used. Whoever should use them, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span> <span class="allowance">I allow, monks, a support for a couch to be eight finger-breadths at the most.</span>"</p>

<p id="p24"><span class="parno">24</span>Now at that time thread accrued to an Order. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: "<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to weave a couch.</span>" The ends used up much thread. "<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, having pierced the ends, to weave small squares.</span>" A piece of cotton cloth accrued. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: "<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to make a carpet.</span>" A cotton quilt accrued to an Order. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: "<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, having unravelled it, to make a squatting mat of three (kinds of) cotton: cotton from trees, cotton from creepers, cotton from grass.</span>"</p>

<p id="p25"><span class="parno">25</span>Now at that time the group of six monks used squatting mats half (the size of a man’s) body. People, touring the dwelling-places, having seen them … spread it about, saying: "Like householders who enjoy pleasures of the senses." They told this matter to the Lord. He said: "<span class="rule">Monks, squatting mats half (the size of a man’s) body should not be used. Who-ever should use one, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span> <span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to make a squatting mat the size of a head.</span>"</p>

<hr>
<p id="p26"><span class="parno">26</span>Now at that time there came to be a festival on a mountain top near Rājagaha. People arranged mattresses for the great ministers: mattresses of wool, mattresses of cotton cloth, mattresses of bark, mattresses of <i>tiṇa</i>-grass, mattresses of leaves. When the festival was over they conveyed them away having taken off the covers. Monks saw much wool and cotton cloth and bark and <i>tiṇa</i>-grass and leaves thrown away at the festival place; and seeing it they told this matter to the Lord. He said: "<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, five (kinds of) mattresses: a mattress of wool … of cotton cloth … of bark … of <i>tiṇa</i>-grass, a mattress of leaves.</span>"</p>

<p id="p27"><span class="parno">27</span>Now at that time woven cloth as a requisite for lodgings accrued to an Order. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: "<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to cover a mattress (with it).</span>"</p>

<p id="p28"><span class="parno">28</span>Now at that time monks packed away a couch-mattress on a chair, they packed away a chair-mattress on a couch; the mattresses fell to bits. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: "<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, a covered couch, a covered chair.</span>"

 They packed them away without having put a cobweb cloth (beneath and the stuffing) came out from below. "<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, having put a cobweb cloth (beneath the mattress), having spread it, to cover a mattress.</span>" Having removed the covers, they carried them away. "<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to sprinkle them.</span>" They still carried them away. "<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, line decoration.</span>" They still carried them away. "<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, the outline of the hand.</span>"</p>

<h4>&nbsp;</h4>

<p id="p29"><span class="parno">29</span>Now at that time the sleeping places of members of other sects were whitewashed, the ground was coloured black, the walls were treated with red chalk. Many people went to see the sleeping places. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: "<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, whitewash, black colouring, red chalk (to be used) in a dwelling-place.</span>"</p>

<p id="p30"><span class="parno">30</span>Now at that time the whitewash did not adhere to the rough walls. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: "<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, having applied lumps of grain-husks, having kept some back with a spoon, to put on the whitewash.</span>" The whitewash would not stick on. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: "<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, having applied soft clay, having kept some back with a spoon, to put on the whitewash.</span>" The whitewash would not stick on. "<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, what exudes from trees and flour-paste.</span>"</p>

<p id="p31"><span class="parno">31</span>Now at that time the red chalk did not adhere to the rough walls … <span class="add"><i>as above</i></span> … The red chalk would not stick on.

They told this matter to the Lord. He said: "<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, mustard-powder, oil of beeswax.</span>" It was too thick. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: "<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to sponge it over with a piece of cloth.</span>"</p>

<p id="p50"><span class="parno">50</span>Now at that time the householder Anāthapiṇḍika was the husband of a sister of a (great) merchant of Rājagaha. Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika went to Rājagaha on some business or other. At that time the Order with the Awakened One at its head had been invited for the morrow by the (great) merchant of Rājagaha. Then the (great) merchant of Rājagaha enjoined slaves and servants, saying: "Well now, good people, getting up early in the morning, cook conjeys, cook rice, prepare curries, prepare vegetables." Then it occurred to the householder Anāthapiṇḍika: "Now, on my arrival formerly this householder, having put aside all duties, did nothing except exchange greetings with me, but now he seems excited and enjoins slaves and servants, saying: ‘Well now, good people … prepare vegetables.’ Now can there be for this householder a leading to (a bride’s home) or can there be a leading away from (a bride’s home) or is a great oblation arranged or is King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha invited for the morrow together with his troops?"</p>

<p id="p51"><span class="parno">51</span>Then the (great) merchant of Rājagaha, having enjoined the slaves and servants, approached the householder Anāthapiṇḍika; having approached, having exchanged greetings with the householder Anāthapiṇḍika, he sat down at a respectful distance. The householder Anāthapiṇḍika spoke thus to the (great) merchant of Rājagaha as he was sitting down at a respectful distance: "Formerly you, householder, on my arrival, having put aside all duties, did nothing except exchange greetings with me, but now you seem excited and enjoin slaves and servants, saying: ‘Well now, good people … prepare vegetables.’ Now can there be for you, householder, a leading to … or is King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha invited for the morrow together with his troops?"</p>

<p>"There is to be for me, householder, neither a leading to (a bride’s home), nor is there to be a leading away from (a bride’s home), nor is King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha invited for the morrow together with his troops. But a great oblation is arranged by me: the Order is invited for the morrow with the Awakened One at its head."</p>

<hr>
<p>"Did you, householder, say ‘Awakened One?’"</p>

<p>"‘Awakened One’ I did say, householder."</p>

<p>"Did you, householder, say ‘Awakened One’?"</p>

<p>"‘Awakened One’ I did say, householder."</p>

<p>"Did you, householder, say ‘Awakened One’?"</p>

<p>"‘Awakened One’ I did say, householder."</p>

<hr>
<p>"Even this sound, householder, is hard to come by in the world, that is to say ‘Awakened One, Awakened One.’ Now would it be possible, householder, at this time to go up and see this Lord, a perfected one, a fully Self-awakened One?"</p>

<p>"This time is not a right time, householder, to go up and see this Lord, a perfected one, a fully Self-awakened One. But now, early Tomorrow you shall go up to see this Lord, a perfected one, a fully Self-awakened One."</p>

<p>Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika, thinking: "Early Tomorrow I will go up to see this Lord … fully Self-Awakened One," lay down with mindfulness (so much) directed to the Awakened One, that he got up three times during the night thinking it was daybreak.</p>

<p id="p52"><span class="parno">52</span>Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika approached the gateway to the Cool Grove, and non-human beings opened the gateway. Then as the householder Anāthapiṇḍika was going out from the town, light vanished, darkness appeared; fear, consternation, hair standing on end arose so that he was desirous of turning back from there. Then the <i>yakkha</i> Sīvaka, invisible, made this sound heard:</p>

<hr>
<p id="p53" class="verse"><span class="parno">53</span>"A hundred elephants, a hundred horses, a hundred chariots with she-mules,
<br>A hundred thousand maidens adorned with jewelled earrings — 
<br>These are not worth the sixteenth part of one length of stride.</p>

<p id="p54" class="verse"><span class="parno">54</span>Advance, householder, advance, householder.
<br>Advance is better for you, not retreat."</p>

<hr>
<p><span class="parno">55–57</span>Then darkness vanished for the householder Anāthapiṇḍika, light appeared, so that his fear, consternation, hair standing on end subsided. And a second time … And a third time did the <i>yakkha</i> Sīvaka made this sound heard: " … Advance is better for you, not retreat."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p58"><span class="parno">58</span>And a third time darkness vanished for the householder Anāthapiṇḍika, light appeared, so that his fear, consternation, hair standing on end subsided.</p>

<p>Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika approached the Cool Grove. Now at that time the Lord was pacing up and down in the open air, having got up in the night towards dawn. Then the Lord saw the householder Anāthapiṇḍika coming in the distance; seeing him, having stepped down from the place for pacing up and down in, he sat down on an appointed seat, and sitting down the Lord spoke thus to the householder Anāthapiṇḍika: "Come, Sudatta." Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika, thinking: "The Lord addressed me by name," joyful, elated, approached the Lord; having approached, having inclined his head to the Lord’s feet, he spoke thus to the Lord: "I hope, Lord, that the Lord is living at ease." He said:</p>


<p id="p59" class="verse"><span class="parno">59</span>"Yes, always at ease he lives, the brahmin, attained to nibbāna,
<br>Who is not stained by lusts, cooled, without attachments.</p>

<p id="p60" class="verse"><span class="parno">60</span>Having rent all clingings, having averted heart’s care,
<br>Tranquil he lives at ease, having won to peace of mind."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p61"><span class="parno">61</span>Then the Lord talked a progressive talk to the householder Anāthapiṇḍika, that is to say talk on giving, talk on moral habit, talk on heaven, he explained the peril, the vanity, the depravity of pleasures of the senses, the advantage in renouncing (them). When the Lord knew that the mind of the householder Anāthapiṇḍika was ready, malleable, devoid of the hindrances, uplifted, pleased, then he explained to him that teaching on dhamma which the awakened ones have themselves discovered: ill, uprising, stopping, the Way. And as a clean cloth without black specks will easily take dye, even so as he was (sitting) on that very seat, dhamma-vision, dustless, stainless, arose to the householder Anāthapiṇḍika, that "whatever is liable to uprising, all that is liable to stopping." Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika, having seen dhamma, attained dhamma, known dhamma, plunged into dhamma, having crossed over doubt, having put away uncertainty, having attained without another’s help to full confidence in the Teacher’s instruction, spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

<p>"Excellent, Lord! Excellent, Lord! Even, Lord, as one might set upright what has been upset, or might uncover what was concealed, or might show the way to one who is astray, or might bring an oil lamp into the darkness, thinking, ‘Those with eyes to see may see shapes,’ even so is dhamma explained in many a figure by the Lord. I myself, Lord, go to the Lord for refuge, to dhamma, and to the Order of monks. May the Lord accept me as a lay-disciple going for refuge from this day forth for as long as life lasts. And, Lord, may the Lord consent to a meal with me on the morrow together with the Order of monks." The Lord consented by becoming silent.</p>

<p id="p62"><span class="parno">62</span>Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika, having understood the Lord’s consent, rising from his seat, having greeted the Lord, departed keeping his right side towards him.</p>

<p>The (great) merchant of Rājagaha heard: "It is said that the Order with the Awakened One at its head is invited for the morrow by the householder Anāthapiṇḍika."</p>

<p id="p63"><span class="parno">63</span>Then the (great) merchant of Rājagaha spoke thus to the householder Anāthapiṇḍika: "It is said, that the Order with the Awakened One at its head is invited by you, householder, for the morrow. But you are incoming. I can give you, householder, the means by which you can make a meal for the Order with the Awakened One at its head."</p>

<p>"Thank you, householder, but I have the means by which I can make a meal for the Order with the Awakened One at, its head."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p64"><span class="parno">64</span>The urban council of Rajagana heard: "The Order with the Awakened One at its head is invited for the morrow by the householder Anāthapiṇḍika." Then the urban council of Rājagaha spoke thus to the householder Anāthapiṇḍika: "It is said that the Order … We can give you, householder, the means by which you can make a meal for the Order with the Awakened One at its head."</p>

<p>"Thank you, masters, but I have the means … at its head."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p65"><span class="parno">65</span>King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha heard: "The Order … " …</p>

<hr>
<p>"Thank you, sire, but I have the means by which I can make a meal for the Order with the Awakened One at its head."

<br>
<hr>
<p id="p66"><span class="parno">66</span>Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika, having had sumptuous foods, solid and soft, prepared towards the end of that night in the dwelling of the (great) merchant of Rājagaha, had the time announced to the Lord, saying: "It is time, Lord, the meal is ready." Then the Lord, having dressed in the morning, taking his bowl and robe, approached the dwelling of the (great) merchant of Rājagaha; having approached, he sat down on the appointed seat together with the Order of monks. Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika, having with his own hand served and satisfied with sumptuous foods, solid and soft, the Order of monks with the Awakened One at its head, when the Lord had eaten and had withdrawn his hand from the bowl, sat down at a respectful distance. As he was sitting down at a respectful distance, the householder Anāthapiṇḍika spoke thus to the Lord: "Lord, may the Lord consent to a rains-residence from me at Sāvatthī together with the Order of monks."</p>

<p>"But, householder, Truth-finders delight in empty places."</p>

<p>"It is understood, Lord, it is understood, Well-farer." Then the Lord, having gladdened, rejoiced, roused, delighted the householder Anāthapiṇḍika with talk on dhamma, rising from his seat, departed.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p67"><span class="parno">67</span>Now at that time the householder Anāthapiṇḍika had many friends, many companions, his word carried weight. Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika, having concluded that business at Rājagaha, set out for Sāvatthī. Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika enjoined people on the way, saying: "Masters, build monasteries, prepare dwelling-places, furnish gifts; an Awakened One has arisen in the world, and this Lord, invited by me, will come along by this road."</p>

<p>Then these people, urged on by the householder Anāthapiṇḍika, built monasteries, prepared dwelling-places, furnished gifts.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p68"><span class="parno">68</span>Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika, having arrived at Sāvatthī, looked all round Sāvatthī, thinking: "Now where could the Lord stay that would be neither too far from a village, nor too near, suitable for coming and going, accessible to people whenever they want, not crowded by day, having little noise at night, little sound, without folks’ breath, secluded from people, fitting for meditation?"</p>

<p id="p69"><span class="parno">69</span>Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika saw Prince Jeta’s pleasure grove, neither too far from a village … fitting for meditation, and seeing it, he approached Prince Jeta; having approached he spoke thus to Prince Jeta: "Give me, young master, the pleasure grove to make a monastery."</p>

<hr>
<p>"The pleasure grove is not to be given away, householder, even for the price of a hundred thousand."</p>

<p>"Young master, the monastery is taken."</p>

<hr>
<p>"The monastery is not taken, householder." They asked the chief ministers of justice, saying: "Is it taken or is it not taken?" The chief ministers spoke thus: "The monastery is taken at the price fixed by you, young master." Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika, having had gold coins brought out by means of wagons, had the Jeta Grove spread with the price of a hundred thousand.</p>

<p>The gold coins that were taken out the first time were not enough for a small open space near to the porch. Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika enjoined the people, saying: "Go back, good people, bring (more) gold coins, I will spread this open space."</p>

<p id="p70"><span class="parno">70</span>Then it occurred to Prince Jeta: "Now this can be no ordinary matter inasmuch as this householder bestows so many gold coins," and he spoke thus to the householder Anāthapiṇḍika:</p>

<p>"Enough, householder; let me spread this open space, give this open space to me, it will be my gift."</p>

<p>Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika, thinking: "This Prince Jeta is a distinguished, well-known man; surely the faith in this dhamma and discipline of well-known men like this is very efficacious," made over that open space to Prince Jeta. Then Prince Jeta built a porch on that open space.</p>

<p id="p71"><span class="parno">71</span>The householder Anāthapiṇḍika had dwelling-places made, he had cells made … porches … attendance halls … fire halls … huts for what is allowable … privies … places for pacing up and down in … halls in the places for pacing up and down in … wells … halls at the wells … bathrooms … halls in the bathrooms … lotus ponds … he had sheds made.</p>

<h4>&nbsp;</h4>

<p id="p72"><span class="parno">72</span>Then the Lord, having stayed at Rājagaha for as long as he found suiting, set out on tour for Vesālī. In due course, walking on tour, he arrived at Vesālī. The Lord stayed there at Vesālī in the Great Grove in the Hall of the Gabled Pillars. Now at that time people were making repairs carefully and they were also attending carefully, with the requisites of robes, almsfood, lodgings and medicines for the sick, to those monks who were looking after the repairs. Then it occurred to a certain poor tailor: "Now this can be no ordinary matter inasmuch as these people are making repairs carefully. What now if I too should make repairs?" Then that poor tailor, having himself kneaded mud, having piled up bricks, had wattle and daub walls erected. But because he was not skilful the piling was crooked and a wall fell down. And a second time … And a third time … a wall fell down.</p>

<p>Then that poor tailor … spread it about, saying: "These recluses, sons of the Sakyans, exhort, instruct those who give them the requisites of robes, almsfood, lodgings, medicines for the sick, and these look after their repairs. But I am poor. No one exhorts or instructs me or looks after my repairs."</p>

<p id="p73"><span class="parno">73</span>Monks heard this poor tailor as he was … spreading it about. Then these monks told this matter to the Lord. Then the Lord on this occasion, in this connection, having given reasoned talk, addressed the monks, saying:</p>

<p>"I allow you, monks, to put repairs in charge (of a monk). Monks, the monk who is in charge of repairs should make an effort, thinking, ‘How can the dwelling-place be brought to a rapid termination?’ and he should restore broken and dilapidated parts.</p>

<p>"And thus, monks, should they be given in charge: First, a monk should be asked; having asked him, the Order should be informed by an experienced, competent monk, saying:

<br>
<p id="p74"><span class="parno">74</span>‘<span class="kamma">Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. If it seems right to the Order, let the Order give the repairs to the dwelling-place of the householder So-and-so in charge of the monk So-and-so.</span> This is the motion.</p>

<p id="p75"><span class="parno">75</span>Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. The Order is giving the repairs … in charge of the monk So-and-so. If the giving in charge of the monk So-and-so, of the repairs to the dwelling-place of the householder So-and-so, is pleasing to the venerable ones, they should be silent; he to whom it is not pleasing should speak.</p>

<p id="p76"><span class="parno">76</span>Repairs to the dwelling-place of the householder So-and-so are given in charge of the monk So-and-so. It is pleasing to the Order; therefore it is silent. Thus do I understand this’."</p>

<h4>&nbsp;</h4>

<p id="p77"><span class="parno">77</span>Then the Lord, having stayed at Vesālī for as long as he found suiting, set out on tour for Sāvatthī. Now at that time monks who were pupils of the group of six monks, having gone along in front of the Order of monks with the Awakened One at its head, took possession of dwelling-places, they took possession of sleeping places, saying: "This will be for our preceptors, this will be for our teachers, this will be for us."</p>

<p id="p78"><span class="parno">78</span>Then the venerable Sāriputta, having gone along close behind the Order of monks with the Awakened One at its head, not being able to get a sleeping place — the dwelling-places being taken possession of, the sleeping places being taken possession of — sat down at the root of a certain tree. Then the Lord, getting up during the night towards morning, coughed. The venerable Sāriputta also coughed.</p>

<hr>
<p>"Who is there?"</p>

<p>"It is I, Lord, Sāriputta."</p>

<p>"Why are you, Sāriputta, sitting here?" Then the venerable Sāriputta told this matter to the Lord.</p>

<hr>
<p>Then the Lord on this occasion, in this connection, having had the Order of monks convened, questioned the monks, saying: "Is it true, as is said, monks, that monks who are pupils … ‘ … this will be for us’?"</p>

<p>"It is true, Lord." The Awakened One, the Lord rebuked them, saying:</p>

<p>"How, monks, can these foolish men, having gone along in front of … saying ‘ … this will be for us’? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … " And having rebuked them, having given reasoned talk, he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

<p id="p79"><span class="parno">79</span>"Who, monks, is worthy of the best seat, the best water (for washing), the best alms?" Some monks spoke thus: "Whoever, Lord, has gone forth from a noble family, he is worthy of the best … alms." Some monks spoke thus: "Whoever, Lord, has gone forth from a brahmin family … from a householder’s family … Whoever, Lord, knows the <i>suttantas</i> … is an expert on discipline … is a teacher of dhamma … is possessed of the first meditation … is possessed of the second meditation … is possessed of the third meditation … is possessed of the fourth meditation … is a stream winner … a once-returner … a non-returner … one perfected … a threefold wisdom man … a sixfold superknowledge man, he is worthy of the best seat, the best water (for washing), the best alms."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p80"><span class="parno">80</span>Then the Lord addressed the monks, saying: "Formerly, monks, there used to be a large banyan on a slope of the Himalayas. Three friends lived near it: a partridge, a monkey and a bull-elephant. These lived courteous, deferential, polite to one another. Then, monks, it occurred to these friends: ‘Now let us find out which of us is the eldest by birth. We should respect, revere, reverence, honour him, and we should abide by his advice.’</p>

<hr>
<p id="p81"><span class="parno">81</span>Then, monks, the partridge and the monkey asked the bull-elephant: ‘You, friend, what long-ago thing do you remember?’</p>

<p>"‘When I, friends, was young I used to pass over this banyan keeping it between my thighs, and the topmost shoots brushed against my belly. This, friends, is a long-ago thing that I remember.’</p>

<p id="p82"><span class="parno">82</span>"Then, monks, the partridge and the bull-elephant asked the monkey: ‘You, friend, what long-ago thing do you remember?’</p>

<p>"‘When I, friends, was young, having sat down on the ground, I used to eat the topmost shoots of this banyan. This, friends, is a long-ago thing that I remember.’</p>

<p id="p83"><span class="parno">83</span>"Then, monks, the monkey and the bull-elephant asked the partridge: ‘You, friend, what long-ago thing do you remember?’</p>

<p>"‘Friends, in a certain open space there was a great banyan. I, having eaten one of its fruits, relieved myself in that open space, and this banyan has grown from that. So I, friends, am the eldest by birth’.</p>

<p id="p84"><span class="parno">84</span>"Then, monks, the monkey and the bull-elephant spoke thus to the partridge: ‘You, friend, are the eldest of us by birth. We will respect, revere, reverence, honour you and we will abide by your advice.’</p>

<p>"Then, monks, the partridge caused the monkey and the bull-elephant to undertake the five moral habits and himself followed the observance of the five moral habits. They, having lived courteous, deferential, polite to one another, at the breaking up of the body after dying arose in a happy bourn, a heaven world. This, monks, came to be known as the ‘Partridge Brahma-faring.’</p>

<p id="p86"><span class="parno">86</span>"Well then, monks, if animals, breathers, can live courteous, deferential, polite to one another, so do you, monks, let your light shine forth here so that you, gone forth in this dhamma and discipline which are well taught, live likewise courteous, deferential, polite to one another. It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … " Having given reasoned talk, he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

<p>"I allow, monks, greeting, rising up for, joining the palms in salutation, proper homage, the best seat, the best water (for washing), the best alms according to seniority. But, monks, what belongs to an Order should not be reserved according to seniority. Whoever should (so) reserve it, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</p>

<h4>&nbsp;</h4>

<p id="p87"><span class="parno">87</span>"Monks, there are these ten who are not to be greeted: one ordained later is not to be greeted by one ordained earlier; one not ordained is not to be greeted; one belonging to a different communion (even) if he is more senior (yet) speaks what is not-dhamma is not to be greeted; a woman is not to be greeted; a eunuch … one under probation … one who deserves to be sent back to the beginning … one who deserves <i>mānatta</i> … one undergoing <i>mānatta</i> … one deserving rehabilitation is not to be greeted.

<p id="p88"><span class="parno">88</span>These three, monks, are to be greeted: one ordained earlier is to be greeted by one ordained later; one belonging to a different communion if he is more senior and speaks what is dhamma is to be greeted; and, monks, a Truth-finder, a perfected one, a fully Self-awakened one is to be greeted in the world with its <i>devas</i>, with its Māras, with its Brahmās, by creatures with recluses and brahmins, with devas and mankind. These three, monks, are to be greeted."</p>

<h4>&nbsp;</h4>

<p id="p89"><span class="parno">89</span>Now at that time people prepared sheds for an Order, they prepared rugs, they prepared open spaces. Monks who were pupils of the group of six monks, saying: "Only what belongs to an Order is not allowed according to seniority by the Lord, not what is made on purpose for it," having gone along in front of the Order of monks with the Awakened One at its head, took possession of the sheds, took possession of the rugs, took possession of the open spaces, thinking: "This will be for our preceptors, this will be for our teachers, this will be for us." Then the venerable Sāriputta, having gone along close behind the Order of monks with the Awakened One at its head, not having a chance to get an open space — the sheds being taken possession of, the rugs being taken possession of, the open spaces being taken possession of — sat down at the root of a certain tree. Then the Lord, getting up during the night towards morning, coughed. The venerable Sāriputta also coughed.</p>

<hr>
<p>"Who is there?"</p>

<p>"It is I, Lord, Sāriputta."</p>

<hr>
<p>"Why are you, Sāriputta, sitting here?" Then the venerable Sāriputta told this matter to the Lord. Then the Lord on this occasion, in this connection, having had the Order of monks convened, questioned the monks, saying: "Is it true, as is said, monks, … ?" … Having rebuked them, having given reasoned talk, he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

<p id="p90"><span class="parno">90</span>Now at that time in a refectory inside a house people appointed high and broad things to recline upon, that is to say: a sofa, a divan, a long-haired coverlet, a many-coloured coverlet, a white coverlet, a wool coverlet besprent with flowers, a cotton quilt, a wool coverlet decorated with animals forms, a wool covering with hair on the upper side, a wool covering with hair at one side, a silken sheet studded with jewels, a sheet made with silk thread and studded with jewels, a dancer’s carpet, an elephant rug, a horse rug, a chariot rug, rugs of black antelope skins, a splendid sheeting of the hide of the <i>kadali</i>-deer, a sheet with an awning above, a couch with a red cushion at either end. Monks, being scrupulous, did not sit down on them. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: "<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, except for the three: a sofa, a divan, a cotton quilt, to sit down on what is displayed by householders, but not to lie down on it.</span>"</p>

<p id="p91"><span class="parno">91</span>Now at that time in a refectory inside a house people appointed a couch and a chair, both covered up with cotton.

<p id="p92"><span class="parno">92</span>Then the Lord, walking on tour, in due course arrived at Sāvatthī. The Lord stayed there at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika approached the Lord; having approached, having greeted the Lord, he sat down at a respectful distance. As he was sitting down at a respectful distance the householder Anāthapiṇḍika spoke thus to the Lord: "Lord, may the Lord consent to a meal with me on the morrow together with the Order of monks." The Lord consented by becoming silent.</p>

<p id="p93"><span class="parno">93</span>Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika, having understood the Lord’s consent, rising from his seat departed keeping his right side towards him. Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika, having had sumptuous foods, solid and soft, prepared towards the end of that night, had the time announced to the Lord, saying: "It is time, Lord, the meal is ready." Then the Lord, having dressed in the morning, taking his bowl and robe, approached the dwelling of the householder Anāthapiṇḍika; having approached, he sat down on the appointed seat together with the Order of monks. Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika, having with his own hand served and satisfied the Order of monks with the Awakened One at its head with sumptuous foods, solid and soft, when the Lord had eaten and had withdrawn his hand from his bowl, sat down at a respectful distance. As he was sitting down at a respectful distance the householder Anāthapiṇḍika spoke thus to the Lord: "What line of conduct am I, Lord, to follow in regard to the Jeta Grove?"</p>

<p>"Well now, do you, householder, have the Jeta Grove prepared for (the use of) the Order of the four quarters, present and to come."</p>

<p>"Very well, Lord," and the householder Anāthapiṇḍika, having answered the Lord in assent, had the Jeta Grove prepared for (the use of) the Order of the four quarters, present and to come.</p>

<p id="p101"><span class="parno">101</span>Now at that time a certain chief minister who was a disciple of the Naked Ascetics had a meal for an Order. The venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, having arrived after (the others) while the meal was yet unfinished, turned away the monk who was next to him, and there was an uproar in the refectory. Then that chief minister … spread it about, saying: "How can these recluses, sons of the Sakyans, having arrived after (the others) turn away monks while a meal is yet unfinished so that there is an uproar in the refectory?

<p>"Your reverences, the group of seventeen monks are repairing a dwelling-place. Come, we will turn them away."</p>

<p>Some spoke thus: "Wait, your reverences, until they have repaired it; when it is repaired, we will turn them away." Then the group of six monks spoke thus to the group of seventeen monks: "Go away, your reverences, the dwelling-place was obtained by us."</p>

<h4>&nbsp;</h4>

<p id="p108"><span class="parno">108</span>Then it occurred to the monks: "Now by whom should lodgings be assigned?"</p>

<p>They told this matter to the Lord. He said: "<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to agree upon a monk endowed with five qualities as assigner of lodgings: one who would not follow a wrong course through desire, one who would not follow a wrong course through hatred, one who would not follow a wrong course through stupidity, one who would not follow a wrong course through fear, and one who would know what is taken and what is not taken.</span> And thus, monks, should he be agreed upon:</p>

<p id="p109"><span class="parno">109</span>First, a monk should be asked. Having asked him, the Order should be informed by an experienced, competent monk, saying:</p>

<p id="p112"><span class="parno">112</span>The monk So-and-so is agreed upon by the Order as assigner of lodgings. It is pleasing to the Order, therefore it is silent. Thus do I understand this’."</p>

<p id="p113"><span class="parno">113</span>Then it occurred to the monks who were the assigners of lodgings: "Now, how should the lodgings be assigned?" They told this matter to the Lord. He said: "<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, first to count the monks; having counted the monks, to count the sleeping places; having counted the sleeping places, to assign according to the accommodation for sleeping places.</span>" Assigning according to the accommodation for sleeping places (some) sleeping places were left over.

<p>When an additional share had been occupied another monk arrived. "It need not be given (to him if the occupier) is not willing."</p>

<p id="p114"><span class="parno">114</span>Now at that time monks assigned lodgings to one who was standing outside a boundary. They told this matter to the Lord.

<p id="p115"><span class="parno">115</span>Now at that time monks, having occupied lodgings, reserved them for all time. They told this matter to the Lord.

<p id="p116"><span class="parno">116</span>Then it occurred to the monks: "Now, how many (times for) the assignment of lodgings are there?" They told this matter to the Lord. He said: "Monks, there are these three (times for) the assignment of lodgings: the earlier, the later, the intervening. The earlier on which they are to be assigned is the day following the full moon of Āsāḷha; the later on which they are to be assigned is the month following the full moon of Āsāḷha; the intervening on which they are to be assigned is the day following the Invitation, with reference to the next rains-residence.

Then these monks spoke thus to the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans: "Have you not, reverend Upananda, occupied a lodging in Sāvatthī?"</p>

<p>"Yes, your reverences."</p>

Come, your reverences, let us master discipline under the venerable Upāli," and they, many monks — elders and newly ordained and those of middle standing — mastered discipline under the venerable Upāli. The venerable Upāli, out of respect for the monks who were elders, recited standing, and also the monks who were elders, out of respect for dhamma, had it recited standing, so that the monks who were elders were tired as well as the venerable Upāli.
