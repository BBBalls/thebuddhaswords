 <section class="raw_sutta">
 <div lang="en">

<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>At one time the awakened one, the Lord was staying near Rājagaha on Mount Vulture Peak. Now at that time wanderers belonging to other sects, having collected together on the fourteenth, fifteenth and eighth days of the half-month, spoke dhamma, People came up to them to hear dhamma. They gained affection for the wanderers belonging to other sects, they gained faith (in them), the wanderers belonging to other sects gained adherents.</p>

<p>Then reasoning arose thus in the mind of King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha as he was meditating in seclusion: "At present wanderers belonging to other sects, having collected together on the fourteenth, fifteenth and eighth days of the half-month, speak dhamma. These people go up to them to hear dhamma. They gain affection for the wanderers belonging to other sects, they gain faith (in them), the wanderers belonging to other sects gain adherents. Suppose the masters should also collect together on the fourteenth, fifteenth and eighth days of the half-month?"</p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>Then King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha approached the Lord; having approached, having greeted the Lord, he sat down at a respectful distance, As he was sitting down at a respectful distance, King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha spoke thus to the Lord: "Now, Lord, as I was meditating in seclusion, a reasoning arose in my mind thus: ‘At present wanderers belonging to other sects … should collect together on the fourteenth, fifteenth and eighth days of the half-month?’"</p>

<p>Then the Lord gladdened, rejoiced, roused, delighted King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha with talk on dhamma. Then King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha, gladdened, … delighted by the Lord with talk on dhamma, rising from his seat, having greeted the Lord, departed keeping his right side towards him. Then the Lord, on this occasion, in this connection, having given reasoned talk, addressed the monks, saying:</p>

<p>"<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to assemble together on the fourteenth, fifteenth and eighth days of the half-month.</span>"</p>

<hr>
<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>Now at that time monks, thinking: "It is allowed by the Lord to assemble together on the fourteenth, fifteenth and eighth days of the half-month," having assembled together, sat down in silence. Those people came up to hear dhamma. They looked down upon, criticised, spread it about, saying: "How can these recluses, sons of the Sakyans, having assembled together on the fourteenth, fifteenth and eighth days of the half-month, sit in silence, like dumb pigs? Ought not dhamma to be spoken when they are assembled together?" Monks heard these people who … spread it about. Then these monks told this matter to the Lord. Then the Lord on this occasion, in this connection, having given reasoned talk, addressed the monks, saying:</p>

<p>"<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, having assembled together on the fourteenth, fifteenth and eighth days of the half-month, to speak dhamma.</span>"</p>

<h4>&nbsp;</h4>

<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>Then as the Lord was meditating in seclusion a reasoning arose in his mind thus: "What now if I were to allow those rules of training, laid down by me for monks, (to form) a recital of Pātimokkha for them? It would be a (formal) act of observance for them."</p>

<p>Then the Lord, having emerged from his seclusion in the evening, on this occasion, in this connection having given reasoned talk, addressed the monks, saying: "Now, monks, as I was meditating in seclusion a reasoning arose in my mind thus: ‘What now if I should allow those rules of training, laid down by me for monks, (to form) a recital of Pātimokkha for them? It would be a (formal) act of observance for them’. <span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to recite a Pātimokkha.</span></p>

<hr>
<p>"And thus, monks, should it be recited: The Order should be informed by an experienced, competent monk, saying:</p>

<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>‘<span class="kamma">Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. Today, the fifteenth (day), is an Observance (day). If it seems right to the Order, the Order may carry out Observance, it may recite the Pātimokkha. What is the Order’s first duty? Let the venerable ones announce entire purity. I will recite the Pātimokkha (while) one and all of us present listen properly and pay attention to it. He for whom there may be an offence should reveal it. If there is no offence, you should become silent. By your becoming silent I shall thus know that the venerable ones are quite pure. For as there is an answer for each question, so it is proclaimed up to the third time in an assembly like this. Whatever monk remembering while it is being proclaimed up to the third time that there is an existent offence and should not reveal it, there comes to be conscious lying for him. Now, conscious lying, venerable ones, is a thing called a stumbling-block by the Lord. Therefore the existent offence should be revealed by a monk who remembers that he has fallen (into an offence) and who desires purity; for when it is revealed there comes to be comfort for him.</span>’"</p>

<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span><span class="term">Pātimokkha</span> means: <span class="gloss">this is the beginning, this is the head, this is the foremost of states that are good; therefore it is called Pātimokkha.</span></p>

<p><span class="term">The venerable ones</span> means: <span class="gloss">this — ‘the venerable ones’ — is a term of esteem, this is a term of respect, this is a deferential and honorific designation.</span></p>

<p><span class="term">I will recite</span> means: <span class="gloss">I will explain, I will teach, I will lay down, I will establish, I will make clear, I will analyse, I will make plain.</span></p>

<p><span class="term">To it</span> means: <span class="gloss">to (what) is called the Pātimokkha. </span></p>

<p><span class="term">One and all of us present</span> means: <span class="gloss">as many as there are in this assembly — elders and newly ordained and those of middle standing — these are called ‘one and all of us present’.</span></p>

<p><span class="term">(We) listen properly</span> means: <span class="gloss">having applied ourselves, having attended, we concentrate with all our mind.</span></p>

<p><span class="term">(We) pay attention</span> means: <span class="gloss">we listen, minds one-pointed, minds not distracted, minds not perturbed.</span></p>

<p><span class="term">He for whom there may be an offence</span> means: <span class="gloss">a certain offence of the five classes of offence or a certain offence of the seven classes of offence for an elder or for a newly ordained one or for one of middle standing.</span></p>

<p><span class="term">He should reveal</span> means: <span class="gloss">he should tell, he should make clear, he should open up, he should make plain in the midst of an Order or in the midst of a group or to one individual.</span></p>

<p><span class="term">If there is no offence</span> means: <span class="gloss">either one comes not to be committed or, if fallen into, it is removed.</span></p>

<p><span class="term">You should become silent</span> means: <span class="gloss">you should consent, you should not speak.</span></p>

<p><span class="term">I shall know that you are quite pure</span> means: <span class="gloss">I will know, I will understand.</span></p>

<p><span class="term">For as there is an answer for each question</span> means: <span class="gloss">as one (person) if questioned about one (thing) would answer, so it should be known to that assembly: ‘He questions me’.</span></p>

<p><span class="term">An assembly like this</span> (means): it is called an assembly of monks.</p>

<p><span class="term">It is proclaimed up to the third time</span> means: <span class="gloss">it is proclaimed once and it is proclaimed a second time and it is proclaimed a third time.</span></p>

<p><span class="term">Remembering</span> means: <span class="gloss">knowing, perceiving.</span></p>

<p><span class="term">There is an existent offence</span> means: <span class="gloss">either one comes to be committed or if fallen into is not removed.</span></p>

<p><span class="term">Should not reveal</span> means: <span class="gloss">should not tell, should not make clear, should not open up, should not make plain in the midst of an Order or in the midst of a group or to one individual.</span></p>

<p><span class="term">There comes to be conscious lying for him</span> means: <span class="gloss">What is conscious lying? It is an offence of wrong-doing.</span></p>

<p><span class="term">A thing called a stumbling-block by the Lord</span> means: <span class="gloss">a stumbling-block to what? It is a stumbling-block to the attainment of the first (stage in) meditation, it is a stumbling-block to the attainment of the second (stage in) meditation … the third (stage in) meditation, … the fourth (stage in) meditation, it is a stumbling-block to the attainment of the meditations, of the deliverances, of the contemplations, of the attainments, of the renunciations, of the escapes, of the aloofnesses, of states that are good.</span></p>

<hr>
<p><span class="term">Therefore</span> means: <span class="gloss">for that reason.</span></p>

<p><span class="term">By (a monk) who remembers</span> means: <span class="gloss">by (one) knowing, by (one) perceiving.</span></p>

<p><span class="term">By (a monk) who desires purity</span> means: <span class="gloss">by (one) wishing to remove (an offence), by (one) wishing to be purified.</span></p>

<p><span class="term">Existent offence</span> means: <span class="gloss">either one comes to be committed, or, if fallen into, is not removed.</span></p>

<p><span class="term">Should be revealed</span> means: <span class="gloss">it should be revealed in the midst of an Order or in the midst of a group or to one individual.</span></p>

<p><span class="term">For when it is revealed there comes to be comfort for him</span> means: <span class="gloss">In what is there comfort? There comes to be comfort in the attainment of the first (stage in) meditation, there comes to be comfort in the attainment in the second (stage in) meditation … the third (stage in) meditation … the fourth (stage in) meditation; there comes to be comfort in the attainment of the meditations, of the deliverances, of the contemplations, of the attainments, of the renunciations, of the escapes, of the aloofnesses, of states that are good.</span></p>

<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>Now at that time monks, thinking: "The recital of the Pātimokkha is allowed by the Lord," recited the Pātimokkha daily. They told this matter to the Lord. He said:</p>

<p>"<span class="rule">Monks, the Pātimokkha should not be recited daily. Whoever should (so) recite it, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span> <span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to recite the Pātimokkha on an Observance day.</span>"</p>

<p id="p8"><span class="parno">8</span>Now at that time monks, thinking: "The recital of the Pātimokkha on an Observance day is allowed by the Lord," recited the Pātimokkha three times during the half-month — on the fourteenth, on the fifteenth and on the eighth (days) of the half-month. They told this matter to the Lord. He said:</p>

<p>in the half-month. Whoever should (so) recite it, there is an offence of wrong-doing. <span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to recite the Pātimokkha once in the half-month: either on this fourteenth or on the fifteenth (day).</span>"</p>

<p id="p9"><span class="parno">9</span>Now at that time the group of six monks recited the Pātimokkha according to assembly, each one before his own assembly. They told this matter to the Lord. He said:</p>

<p>"<span class="rule">Monks, the Pātimokkha should not be recited according to assembly, each one before his own assembly, Whoever should (so) recite it, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span> <span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, a (formal) act of Observance for all together."</span></p>

<p id="p10"><span class="parno">10</span>Then it occurred to the monks: "A (formal) act of Observance for all together is allowed by the Lord. Now, how far does ‘being all together’ (go)? As far as one residence, or the whole earth?" They told this matter to the Lord. He said:</p>

<p>"<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, ‘being all together’ (to mean) as far as one residence.</span>"</p>

<h4>&nbsp;</h4>

<p id="p11"><span class="parno">11</span>Now at that time the venerable Kappina the Great was staying near Rājagaha at Maddakucchi in the deer-park. Then as the venerable Kappina the Great was meditating in seclusion a reasoning arose in his mind thus: "Should I go to an Observance or should I not go, should I go to a (formal) act of the Order or should I not go, I, nevertheless, am purified with the highest purification."</p>

<p>Then the Lord, knowing by mind the reasoning in the mind of the venerable Kappina the Great, as a strong man might stretch out his bent arm or might bend back his outstretched arm, even so did he, vanishing from Mount Vulture Peak appear in Maddakucchi in the deer-park before the venerable Kappina the Great. The Lord sat down on an appointed seat, and the venerable Kappina the Great, having greeted the Lord, sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

<p>As the venerable Kappina the Great was sitting down at a respectful distance the Lord spoke thus to him: "Now, Kappina, as you were meditating in seclusion did not a reasoning arise in your mind thus: ‘Should I go to an Observance or should I not go, should I go to a (formal) act of the Order or should I not go, I, nevertheless, am purified with the highest purification’?"</p>

<hr>
<p>"Yes, Lord."</p>

<p>"But if you brahmans do not reverence, revere, esteem, honour the Observance, who is there who will reverence, revere, esteem, honour the Observance? You go along, brahman, to the Observance, do not not go; go likewise to a (formal) act of the Order, do not not go."</p>

<p>"Yes, Lord," the venerable Kappina the Great answered the Lord in assent.</p>

<p>Then the Lord, having gladdened, rejoiced, roused, delighted the venerable Kappina the Great with talk on dhamma, as a strong man might stretch out his bent arm or bend back his outstretched arm, even so did he, vanishing from before the venerable Kappina the Great in Maddakucchi in the deer-park appear on Mount Vulture Peak.</p>

<h4>&nbsp;</h4>

<p id="p12"><span class="parno">12</span>Then it occurred to the monks: "It is laid down by the Lord that ‘being all together’ (means) as far as one residence. Now, how far does one residence (go)?" They told this matter to the Lord. He said:</p>

<p>"<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to agree upon a boundary.</span> And thus, monks, should it be agreed upon: First, marks should be announced, a mark consisting of a hillside, a mark consisting of a rock, a mark consisting of a grove, a mark consisting of a tree, a mark consisting of a road, a mark consisting of an anthill, a mark consisting of a river, a mark consisting of (a piece of) water. The Order, having announced the marks, should be informed by an experienced, competent monk, saying:</p>

<p id="p13"><span class="parno">13</span>‘<span class="kamma">Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. In as much as marks all round are announced, if it seems right to the Order the Order may agree upon a boundary in accordance with these marks for the same communion for one Observance. This is the motion. </span></p>

<p id="p14"><span class="parno">14</span><span class="kamma"> Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. In as much as marks all round are announced, the Order is agreeing upon a boundary in accordance with these marks for the same communion, for one Observance. If the agreement upon a boundary in accordance with these marks for the same communion, for one Observance, is pleasing to the venerable ones, they should be silent; he to whom it is not pleasing should speak. The boundary in accordance with these marks is agreed upon by the Order for the same communion, for one Observance. It is pleasing to the Order, therefore it is silent; thus do I understand this</span>’."</p>

<p id="p15"><span class="parno">15</span>Now at that time the group of six monks, thinking: "An agreement upon a boundary is allowed by the Lord," agreed upon very extensive boundaries, of four <i>yojanas</i> and five <i>yojanas</i> and six <i>yojanas</i>. Monks coming for Observance arrived while the Pātimokkha was being recited, and they arrived just after it had been recited, and they stayed (a night) on the way. They told this matter to the Lord. He said:</p>

<p>"<span class="rule">Monks, a very extensive boundary should not be agreed upon, of four <i>yojanas</i> or five <i>yojanas</i> or six <i>yojanas</i>. Whoever should (so) agree, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span> <span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to agree upon a boundary of three <i>yojanas</i> at most.</span>"</p>

<p id="p16"><span class="parno">16</span>Now at that time the group of six monks agreed upon the other side of a river as a boundary. Monks coming for Observance were carried away and their bowls were carried away and their robes were carried away. They told this matter to the Lord. He said:</p>

<p>"<span class="rule">Monks, the other side of a river should not be agreed upon as a boundary.
