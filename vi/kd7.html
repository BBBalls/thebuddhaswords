 <section class="raw_sutta">
 <div lang="en">

<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>At that time the awakened one, the Lord was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time as many as thirty monks of Pāvā, all forest-dwellers, all almsmen, all wearers of rag-robes, all wearers of the three robes, going to Sāvatthī so as to see the Lord when the beginning of the rains was approaching, were unable to reach Sāvatthī for the beginning of the rains; they entered upon the rains on the way, at Sāketa. They spent the rains in a state of longing, thinking: "The Lord is staying close to us, six <i>yojanas</i> from here, but we are not getting a chance to see the Lord."</p>

<p>Then these monks having, after the lapse of three months, kept the rains, after the Invitation had been carried out, while the god was raining, while waters were gathering, while swamps were forming, with drenched robes and in a state of weariness approached Sāvatthī, the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery, the Lord; having approached, having greeted the Lord, they sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

<p>Now it is the custom for awakened ones, for Lords to exchange friendly greetings with in-coming monks.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>So the Lord spoke thus to these monks:</p>

<p>"I hope, monks, that things went well with you, I hope you had enough to support life, I hope that, in unity, being on friendly terms and harmonious, you spent a comfortable rainy season and did not go short of almsfood?"</p>

<p>"Things did go well with us, Lord, we had enough to support life, Lord, and in unity we, Lord, being on friendly terms and harmonious, spent the rainy season and did not go short of almsfood. Here are we, Lord, as many as thirty monks of Pāvā, coming to Sāvatthī so as to see the Lord, (but) when the beginning of the rains was approaching, we were unable to reach Sāvatthī for the beginning of the rains; we entered on the rains on the way, at Sāketa. We spent the rains, Lord, in a state of longing for you, thinking: ‘The Lord is staying close to us, six <i>yojanas</i> from here, but we are not getting a chance to see the Lord.’ Then we, Lord, having, after the lapse of three months, kept the rains, and after the Invitation had been carried out, while the god was raining, while waters were gathering, while swamps were forming, with drenched robes and in a state of weariness came along on the journey."</p>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>Then the Lord, on this occasion, having given dhamma-talk addressed the monks, saying:</p>

<p>"<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to make up <i>kaṭhina</i>-cloth when monks have completed the rains. Five (things) will be allowable to you, monks, when the kaṭhina-cloths have been made up: going (to families for alms) without having asked for permission, walking (for alms) not taking the three robes, a group-meal, as many robes as you require, and whatever robe-material accrues there, that will be for them. These five (things) will be allowable to you, monks, when the kaṭhina-cloths have been made.</span> And thus, monks, should kaṭhina-cloth be made:</p>

<hr>
<p>"The Order should be informed by an experienced, competent monk, saying:</p>

<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>‘<span class="kamma">Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. This material for kaṭhina-cloth has accrued to the Order. If it seems right to the Order, the Order should give this material for kaṭhina-cloth to the monk so and so for making kaṭhina-cloth. This is the motion.</span></p>

<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. This material for kaṭhina-cloth has accrued to the Order. The Order is giving this material for kaṭhina-cloth to the monk so and so for making kaṭhina-cloth. If the giving of this material for kaṭhina-cloth to the monk so and so for making kaṭhina-cloth is pleasing to the venerable ones, let them be silent. He to whom it is not pleasing should speak.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>This material for kaṭhina-cloth is given by the Order to the monk so and so for making kathiṇa-cloth. It is pleasing to the Order, therefore they are silent. Thus do I understand this.’</p>

<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>"Monks, kaṭhina-cloth becomes made thus, not made thus. And how, monks, does kaṭhina-cloth become not made? kaṭhina-cloth does not become made only by marking it, kaṭhina-cloth does not become made only by washing it; kaṭhina-cloth does not become made only by calculating (the number of) robes (that it will make); kaṭhina-cloth does not become made only by cutting it; kaṭhina-cloth does not become made only by tacking it; kaṭhina-cloth does not become made only by making the lengths; kaṭhina-cloth does not become made only by marking with a piece of cloth; kaṭhina-cloth does not become made only by strengthening the work; kaṭhina-cloth does not become made only by making a braiding; kaṭhina-cloth does not become made only by making a binding;

kaṭhina-cloth does not become made only by patching; kaṭhina-cloth does not become made only by dyeing the garment; kaṭhina-cloth does not become made by insinuation; kaṭhina-cloth does not become made by roundabout talking; kaṭhina-cloth does not become made by its being temporary; kaṭhina-cloth does not become made by postponement; kaṭhina-cloth does not become made if it has to be abandoned; kaṭhina-cloth does not become made if it is not made allowable; kaṭhina-cloth does not become made if it is (made) except for the outer cloak;kaṭhina-cloth does not become made if it is (made) except for the upper robe; kaṭhina-cloth does not become made if it is (made) except for the inner robe; kaṭhina-cloth does not become made unless five parts or more than five parts (of kaṭhina-cloth) are cut out, are hemmed together on that same day; kaṭhina-cloth does not become made unless the making is by an individual. And even if kaṭhina-cloth comes to be quite properly made, but if no one gives thanks for it standing outside the boundary, thus also kaṭhina-cloth comes to be not made. And thus, monks, does kaṭhina-cloth come to be not made.</p>

<p id="p8"><span class="parno">8</span>"And how, monks, does kaṭhina-cloth come to be made? kaṭhina-cloth comes to be made when it is unsoiled; kaṭhina-cloth comes to be made when what is allowable is unsoiled; kaṭhina-cloth comes to be made when it is (made) out of pieces of cloth; kaṭhina-cloth comes to be made when it is (made) out of rag-robes; kaṭhina-cloth comes to be made when it is (made) out of (bits picked up near) a shop; kaṭhina-cloth comes to be made if there is no insinuation; kaṭhina-cloth comes to be made if there is no roundabout talking; kaṭhina-cloth comes to be made if it is not temporary; kaṭhina-cloth comes to be made if there is no postponement; kaṭhina-cloth comes to be made if it has not to be abandoned; kaṭhina-cloth comes to be made if it is made allowable; kaṭhina-cloth comes to be made if there is the outer cloak; kaṭhina-cloth comes to be made if there is the upper robe; kaṭhina-cloth comes to be made if there is the inner robe; kaṭhina-cloth comes to be made if five parts or more than five parts are cut out, are hemmed together on that same day; kaṭhina-cloth comes to be made if the making is by an individual. And if kaṭhina-cloth comes to be quite properly made, and if one gives thanks for it standing on the boundary, kaṭhina-cloth thus also comes to be made. And thus, monks, does kaṭhina-cloth come to be made.</p>

<p id="p9"><span class="parno">9</span>"And how, monks, do the kaṭhina (privileges) become removed? Monks, there are these eight grounds for the removal of the kaṭhina (privileges): that depending on (a monk) going away; that depending on (his robe) being settled; that depending on his resolves (not to have it made up and not to come back); that depending on (the robe) being lost; that depending on his hearing (of the general removal of the privileges in the residence to which he has gone); (that depending on) the disappointment of his expectation (that a special gift of a robe would be made to him); that depending on his having crossed the boundary; (that depending on) the removal (of the kaṭhina privileges) together with (those of the other monks)".</p>

Thus, monks, does the residence-non-impediment come to be. And how, monks, does the robes-non-impediment come to be? In this case, monks, a monk’s robe-material comes to be made up or it is lost or destroyed or burnt or the expectation of a robe is disappointed. Thus, monks, does the robes-non-impediment come to be. These, monks, are the two non-impediments to (the removal of) the kaṭhina (privileges)."</p>
