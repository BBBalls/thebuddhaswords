Now at that time the mango trees in the park of King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha were bearing fruit and it was made known by King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha: "Let the masters make as much use of the mangoes as they please."<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.5.147"></a> The group of six monks, having made even young mangoes fall, made use of them. And<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.2.109"></a> King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha wanted a mango. Then King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha enjoined people, saying: "Go, good sirs, having gone to the park, bring back a mango."</p>

<p>"Very well, your majesty," and these people having answered King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha in assent, having gone to the park, spoke thus to the park keeper: "Good sir, his majesty wants a mango, give (us) a mango."</p>

<p>"There is not a mango, masters; the monks having made even young mangoes fall, have made use of them." Then these people told this matter to King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha. He said: "Good sirs, mangoes are much enjoyed by the masters, yet it is moderation that the Lord extols." People … spread it about, saying: "How can these recluses, sons of the Sakyans, not knowing moderation, make use of the king’s mangoes?" Monks heard these people who … spread it about. Then these monks told this matter to the Lord. He said:</p>

<p><p id="p24"><span class="parno">24</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.15.5.2" href="#Kd.15.5.2"></a>
Now at that time a certain guild came to have food for an Order. Mango peels were put into the curry. Monks, being scrupulous, did not accept. (The Lord said:) "Accept it, monks, make use of it.

Now at that time two monks were going along a high road in the Kosalan country. Ore monk indulged in bad habits. The other monk spoke thus to that monk: "Do not do that, your reverence, it is not allowable." He grumbled at him. Then that monk, tormented by thirst, spoke thus to the monk who had grumbled: "Give me the strainer, your reverence, I will drink (some) water." The monk who had grumbled did not give it. That monk passed away, tormented by thirst. Then that monk, having arrived at a monastery, told this matter to the monks. They said: "But did you, your reverence, (although) being asked, not give a strainer?"</p>

<p>"No, your reverences." Those who were modest monks looked down upon, criticised, spread it about, saying: "How can this monk, when being asked for a strainer, not give it?" Then these monks told this matter to the Lord. Then the Lord on this occasion, in this connection, having had the Order of monks convened, questioned this monk, saying:</p>

<p>"Is it true, as is said, that you, monk, when being asked for a strainer, did not give it?"</p>

<p>"It is true, Lord." The enlightened one, the Lord rebuked him, saying:</p>

<p>Then the Lord, walking on tour gradually arrived at Vesālī. The Lord stayed there in Vesālī in the Great Grove at the Hall of the Gabled Pillars. Now at that time monks were making repairs.

Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca went to Vesālī on some business or other. Jīvaka Komārabhacca saw the monks who were very ill with their bodies full of (bad) humours; seeing them, he approached the Lord; having approached, having greeted the Lord, he sat down at a respectful distance. As he was sitting down at a respectful distance, Jīvaka Komārabhacca spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

<p>"At present, Lord, monks are very ill with their bodies full of (bad) humours. It were well, Lord, if the Lord allowed the monks a place for pacing up and down in and a bathroom. Thus will the monks come to have few afflictions." Then the Lord gladdened, rejoiced, roused, delighted Jīvaka Komārabhacca with talk on dhamma. Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca, gladdened … delighted by the Lord with talk on dhamma, rising from his seat, having greeted the Lord, departed keeping his right side towards him.

Where there was a calm, now there is a gale. It seems as if the very water is blazing. My wife has been seduced by master Dabba the Mallian.’"</p>

<p id="p104"><span class="parno">104</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.15.20.2" href="#Kd.15.20.2"></a>
"Very well, masters," and the Licchavi Vaḍḍha, having answered the monks who were followers of Mettiya and Bhummajaka in assent, approached the Lord; having approached, having greeted the Lord, he sat down at a respectful distance. As he was sitting down at a respectful distance<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.2.125"></a>, the Licchavi Vaḍḍha spoke thus to the Lord: "This, Lord, is not suitable … My wife has been seduced by master Dabba the Mallian."</p>

<p id="p105"><span class="parno">105</span>Then the Lord on this occasion, in this connection, having had the Order of monks convened, questioned the venerable Dabba the Mallian, saying: "Dabba, do you remember doing as this Vaḍḍha says?"</p>

<p>"Lord, the Lord knows in regard to me." And a second time the Lord … And a third time the Lord spoke thus to the venerable Dabba the Mallian: "Dabba, do you remember doing as this Vaḍḍha says?"</p>

<p>"Lord, the Lord knows in regard to me," he said.</p>

<p>"Dabba, the Dabbas do not give evasive answers thus. <a class="pts_pn" id="BD.5.173"></a>
If what was done was done by you, say so: if it was not done by you, say it was not."</p>

<p>"Lord, since I was born I cannot call to mind indulging in sexual intercourse even in a dream; much less so when I was awake."</p>

<p>Then the Lord addressed the monks, saying: "Because of this, monks, let the Order turn the Licchavi Vaḍḍha’s bowl upside down, let it impose non-eating with the Order.</p>

<p id="p106"><span class="parno">106</span>Monks, if a lay-follower is possessed of eight qualities his bowl may be turned upside down: if he tries for non-receiving (of gains) by monks, if he tries for non-profiting by monks, if he tries for non-residence for monks, if he reviles and abuses monks, if he causes monk to break with monk, if he speaks dispraise of the Awakened One, if he speaks dispraise of dhamma, if he speaks dispraise of the Order. I allow you, monks, to turn a lay-follower’s bowl upside down if he is possessed of these eight qualities.</p>

<p>And thus, monks, should it be turned upside down: The Order should be informed by an experienced, competent monk, saying:</p>

<p id="p107"><span class="parno">107</span>‘<span class="kamma">Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me.

<p id="p109"><span class="parno">109</span>The Licchavi Vaḍḍha’s bowl is turned upside down by the Order (and there is to be) non-eating with the Order. It is pleasing to the Order; therefore it is silent. Thus do I understand this.’"</p>

<p id="p110"><span class="parno">110</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.15.20.5" href="#Kd.15.20.5"></a>
Then the venerable Ānanda, having dressed in the morning, taking his bowl and robe, went up to the Licchavi Vaḍḍha’s dwelling; having gone up, he spoke thus to the Licchavi Vaḍḍha: "Your bowl, friend Vaḍḍha, is turned upside down by an Order, you are non-eating with the Order."<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.2.126"></a> Then the Licchavi Vaḍḍha, thinking: "It is said that my bowl is turned upside down by an Order, it is said that I am non-eating with the Order," fainted and fell on that very spot. Then the Licchavi Vaḍḍha’s friends and intimates, his kith and kin spoke thus to the Licchavi Vaḍḍha:</p>

<p>"Enough, Vaḍḍha, do not grieve, do not lament, we will reconcile the Lord and the Order of monks."</p>

<p id="p111"><span class="parno">111</span>Then the Licchavi Vaḍḍha with his wife and children, with his friends and intimates, with his kith and kin, his clothes wet, his hair wet approached the Lord; having approached, he spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

<p>"Lord, a transgression has overcome me, in that I, foolish, misguided, wrong that I was, defamed master Dabba the Mallian with an unfounded charge of falling away from moral habit. For this, Lord, let the Lord acknowledge my transgression as a transgression for the sake of restraint in the future."</p>

<p>"Truly a transgression overcame you, friend Vaḍḍha, in that you, foolish, misguided, wrong that you were, defamed Dabba the Mallian with an unfounded charge of falling away <a class="pts_pn" id="BD.5.175"></a>
from moral habit. But if you, friend Vaḍḍha, having seen the transgression as a transgression, confess according to the rule, we acknowledge it for you. For, friend Vaḍḍha, in the discipline of the noble, this is growth: whoever having seen a transgression as a transgression, confesses it according to the rule, he attains restraint in the future."</p>

<p>Then the Lord addressed the monks, saying: "Well, now monks, let the Order set upright the Licchavi Vaḍḍha’s bowl, let it grant eating with the Order.</p>

<p id="p112"><span class="parno">112</span>Monks, if a lay-follower is possessed of eight qualities his bowl may be set upright: if he does not try for non-receiving (of gains) by monks, if he does not try for non-profiting by monks, if he does not try for non-residence for monks, if he does not revile and abuse monks, if he does not cause monk to break with monk, if he does not speak dispraise of the Awakened One, if he does not speak dispraise of dhamma, if he does not speak dispraise of the Order. I allow you, monks, to set upright a lay-follower’s bowl if he is possessed of these eight qualities.</p>

<p><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.15.20.7" href="#Kd.15.20.7"></a>
"And thus, monks, should it be set upright: Monks, that Licchavi Vaḍḍha, having approached the Order, having arranged his upper robe over one shoulder, having honoured the monks’ feet, having sat down on his haunches, having saluted them with joined palms, should speak thus to them: ‘<span class="kamma">Honoured sirs, my bowl was turned upside down by the Order, I am not eating with the Order. But I, honoured sirs, am conducting myself properly, I am subdued, I am mending my ways, and I ask the Order for the setting upright of the bowl.</span>’ And a second time it should be asked for. And a third time it should be asked for. The Order should be informed by an experienced, competent monk, saying:</p>

<p id="p113"><span class="parno">113</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.2.127"></a> Order, the Order may set upright the Licchavi Vaḍḍha’s bowl, it may grant eating with the Order. This is the motion.</p>

Then the Lord, having stayed in Vesālī for as long as he found suiting, set out on tour for the Bhaggas. In due course, walking on tour, the Lord arrived at the Bhaggas. The Lord stayed there among the Bhaggas on Suṁsumāra Hill in the Bhesakaḷā Grove in the deer park. Now at that time Kokanada was the name of Prince Bodhi’s palace; it had not long been built and was as yet uninhabited by recluse or brahmin or by any human creature. Then Prince Bodhi addressed the brahmin youth, the son of Sañjikā, saying: "Come along, good son of Sañjikā, go up to the Lord; having gone up, in my name salute the Lord’s feet with your head, ask whether he is well, not indisposed, of bodily vigour, strong, abiding in comfort, and say: ‘Lord, Prince Bodhi salutes the Lord’s feet with his head and asks whether he is well … abiding in comfort,’ and says this: ‘Lord, may the Lord consent to a meal with Prince Bodhi tomorrow together with the Order of monks.’"</p>

<p>"Very well, good sir," and the brahmin youth, Sañjikā’s son, having answered Prince Bodhi in assent, approached the Lord; having approached, having exchanged greetings with the Lord, having conversed in a courteous and friendly way, sat down at a respectful distance. As he was sitting down at a respectful distance the brahmin youth, the son of Sanjika, spoke thus to the Lord: "Prince Bodhi salutes the revered Gotama’s feet with his head … and says may the revered Gotama consent to a meal with Prince Bodhi tomorrow together with the Order of monks." The Lord consented by becoming silent.</p>

<p>Then the brahmin youth, Sañjikā’s son, having understood the Lord’s consent, rising from his seat approached Prince Bodhi;<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.2.128"></a> having approached, he spoke thus to Prince Bodhi: "I spoke, good sir, in your name to the Lord Gotama, saying: ‘Prince Bodhi salutes … together with the Order of monks.’ And the recluse Gotama consented."</p>

<p id="p117"><span class="parno">117</span>Then Prince Bodhi towards the end of that night, having had sumptuous foods, solid and soft, prepared, and having had Kokanada palace strewn with white cloths as far as the last flight of stairs, spoke thus to the brahmin youth, the son of Sañjikā: "Come you along, good fellow, approach the Lord; having approached, announce the time to the Lord, saying: ‘It is time, Lord, the meal is ready.’"</p>

<p>"Very well, good sir," and the brahmin youth, Sañjikā’s son, having answered Prince Bodhi in assent, approached the Lord; having approached, he announced the time to the Lord, saying: "It is time, good Gotama, the meal is ready."</p>

<p id="p118"><span class="parno">118</span>Then the Lord, having dressed in the morning, taking his bowl and robe, approached Prince Bodhi’s dwelling. Now at the time when the Lord was coming Prince Bodhi was standing at the porch of the outside gateway. Prince Bodhi saw the Lord coming in the distance, and seeing him, having gone from there to meet him, having greeted the Lord, having honoured him, he approached Kokanada palace. Then the Lord stood still at the last flight of stairs. Then Prince Bodhi spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

<p>"Lord, let the Lord tread on the cloths, let the well-farer <a class="pts_pn" id="BD.5.178"></a>
tread on the cloths so that it may be for a long time for my blessing and happiness." When he had spoken thus the Lord became silent. And a second time … And a third time Prince Bodhi spoke thus to the Lord: "Lord, let the Lord tread on … for my blessing and happiness." Then the Lord looked towards the venerable Ānanda. Then the venerable Ānanda spoke thus to Prince Bodhi:</p>

<p>"Let the cloths, prince, be packed away, the Lord will not tread upon the cloth carpeting, the Truth-finder has compassion for the folk who come after."</p>

<p id="p119"><span class="parno">119</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.15.21.3" href="#Kd.15.21.3"></a>
Then Prince Bodhi, having had the cloths packed away, had a seat made ready upstairs in Kokanada. Then the Lord having ascended the Kokanada palace, sat down together with the Order of monks on the seat made ready. Then Prince Bodhi, having with his own hand served and satisfied with sumptuous foods, solid and soft, the Order of monks with the Awakened One at its head, when the Lord had eaten and had withdrawn his hand from the bowl, sat down at a respectful distance. Then the Lord, having gladdened, rejoiced, roused, delighted Prince Bodhi as he was sitting at a respectful distance with talk on dhamma,<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.2.129"></a> rising from his seat, departed. Then the Lord on this occasion, in this connection, having given reasoned talk, addressed the monks, saying: "<span class="rule">Monks, you should not tread on a cloth carpeting.

Now at that time a certain woman who had had a miscarriage, having invited monks, having had cloth prepared, spoke thus: "Revered sirs, tread on the cloth." The monks, being scrupulous, did not tread on it. She said: "Revered<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.5.179"></a> sirs, tread on the cloth for good luck’s sake." The monks, being scrupulous, did not tread on it. Then that woman spread it about, saying: "How can these masters (although) being asked for good luck’s sake not tread on the cloth carpeting?" Monks heard this woman who … spread it about. Then these monks told this matter to the Lord. He said: "Householders, monks, look out for lucky signs.
<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, when being asked by householders for good luck’s sake, to tread on a cloth carpeting.</span>"</p>

<p><p id="p121"><span class="parno">121</span>Now at that time monks were doubtful whether to tread on a sheet for use after feet had been washed. They told this matter to the Lord.

The Second Portion for Repeating</p>

<p id="p123"><span class="parno">123</span>Then the Lord having stayed among the Bhaggas for as long as he found suiting set out on tour for Sāvatthī. Walking on tour in due course he arrived at Sāvatthī. The Lord stayed there at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Then Visākhā, Migāra’s mother, taking a small jar and a (clay foot-) scrubber and a broom, approached the Lord; having approached, having greeted the Lord, she sat down at a respectful distance. As she was sitting down at a respectful distance, Visākhā, Migāra’s mother, spoke thus to the Lord: "Lord, may the Lord accept my little jar and (clay foot-) scrubber and broom so that it may be for a long time for my blessing and happiness." The Lord accepted the little jar and the broom; the Lord did not accept the (clay foot-) scrubber. Then the Lord gladdened, rejoiced, roused, delighted Visākhā, Migāra’s mother, with talk on
dhamma. Then<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.5.180"></a> Visākhā, Migāra’s mother gladdened … delighted by the Lord with talk on dhamma, rising from her seat, having greeted the Lord, departed keeping her right side towards him.</p>

<p id="p124"><span class="parno">124</span>Then<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.2.130"></a> the Lord on this occasion, in this connection, having given reasoned talk, addressed the monks, saying:</p>

As she was sitting down at a respectful distance, Visākhā, Migāra’s mother, spoke thus to the Lord: "Lord, may the Lord accept my fan and a palmyra-whisk so that it may be for a long time for my blessing and happiness." The Lord accepted fan and a palmyra-whisk; Then the Lord on this occasion, in this connection, having given reasoned talk, addressed the monks, saying: "<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, a fan and a palmyra-whisk.</span>"</p>

<p>"These, masters, are not monks, they are wanderers." They made a bet as to whether they were monks or not. Then that lay-follower, having recognised them as they came up, looked down upon, criticised, spread it about, saying: "How can these revered sirs <a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.2.131"></a>
