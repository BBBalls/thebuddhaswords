Then the Lord sat cross-legged in one (posture) for seven days at the foot of the Tree of Awakening experiencing the bliss of freedom. Then the Lord during the first watch of the night paid attention to causal uprising in direct and reverse order:</p>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.1.2"></a>Conditioned by ignorance are the habitual tendencies; conditioned by the habitual tendencies is consciousness; conditioned by consciousness is psycho-physicality; conditioned by psycho-physicality are the six (sense-) spheres; conditioned by the six (sense-) spheres is awareness; conditioned by awareness is feeling; conditioned by feeling is craving; conditioned by craving is grasping; conditioned by grasping is becoming; conditioned by becoming is birth; conditioned by birth, old age and dying, grief, sorrow and lamentation, suffering, dejection and despair come into being. Such is the arising of this entire mass of ill.</p>

<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span><a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.2"></a>But from the utter fading away and stopping of this very ignorance (comes) the stopping of habitual tendencies; from the stopping of habitual tendencies the stopping of consciousness; from the stopping of consciousness the stopping of psycho-physicality; from the stopping of psycho-physicality the stopping of the six (sense-) spheres; from the stopping of the six (sense-) spheres the stopping of awareness; from the stopping of awareness the stopping of feeling; from the stopping of feeling the stopping of craving; from the stopping of craving the stopping of grasping; from the stopping of grasping the stopping of becoming; from the stopping of becoming the stopping of birth; from the stopping of birth, old age and dying, grief, sorrow and lamentation, suffering, dejection and despair are stopped.

<hr>
<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.1.3"></a>Then the Lord, having understood this matter, at that time uttered this (solemn) utterance:</p>

<br>His doubts all vanish
<br>in that he comprehends thing-with-cause."</p>

<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.1.4"></a>Then the Lord during the middle watch of the night paid attention to causal uprising in direct and reverse order: conditioned by ignorance are the habitual tendencies; conditioned by the habitual tendencies is consciousness … Such is the arising … Such is the stopping of this entire mass of ill.</p>

<p id="p8"><span class="parno">8</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.1.5"></a>Then the Lord, having understood this matter, at that time uttered this (solemn) utterance:</p>

<p id="p10"><span class="parno">10</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.1.6"></a><a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.3"></a>Then the Lord during the last watch of the night paid attention to causal uprising in direct and reverse order: conditioned by ignorance are the habitual tendencies; conditioned by the habitual tendencies is consciousness … Such is the arising … Such is the stopping of this entire mass of ill.</p>

<p id="p11"><span class="parno">11</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.1.7"></a>Then the Lord, having understood this matter, at that time uttered this (solemn) utterance:</p>

<blockquote>
<p id="p12"><span class="parno">12</span>"Truly, when things grow plain
<br>to the ardent meditating brahman,
<br>Routing the host of Māra does he stand
<br>Like as the sun when lighting up the sky."</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="endsutta"><span class="parno">13</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.1.8"></a>Told is the Talk on Awakening.</p>

<h4>&nbsp;</h4>

<p id="p14"><span class="parno">14</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.2"></a><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.2.1"></a>Then the Lord, having emerged from that contemplation at the end of seven days, approached the Goatherds’ Banyan from the foot of the Tree of Awakening; having approached, he sat cross-legged in one (posture) for seven days at the foot of the Goatherds’ Banyan experiencing the bliss of freedom.</p>

<p><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.2.2"></a>Then a certain brahman of the class uttering the sound <i>huṁ</i> approached the Lord; having approached, he exchanged greetings with the Lord; having exchanged greetings of friendliness and courtesy, he stood at a respectful distance. As he was standing at a respectful distance, that brahman<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.3"></a> spoke thus to the Lord: "To what extent, good Gotama, does one become a brahman? And again, what are the things which make a brahman?"</p>

<p><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.2.3"></a>Then the Lord, having understood this matter, at that time uttered this (solemn) utterance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="p15"><span class="parno">15</span><a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.4"></a>"That brahman who bars out evil things,
<br>not uttering the sound <i>hum</i>,
<br>with no impurity, curbed-of-self,
<br>Master of Vedas, who lives the Brahma-faring — 
<br>this is the brahman who may rightly speak the Brahma-speech
<br>Who has no blemishes anywhere in the world."</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="endsutta"><span class="parno">16</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.2.4"></a>Told is the Talk at the Goatherds’.</p>

<h4>&nbsp;</h4>

<p id="p17"><span class="parno">17</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.3"></a><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.3.1"></a>Then the Lord, at the end of seven days, having emerged from that contemplation, approached the Mucalinda (tree) from the foot of the Goatherds’ Banyan; having approached, he sat cross-legged in one (posture) for seven days at the foot of the Mucalinda experiencing the bliss of freedom.</p>

<p><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.3.2"></a>Now at that time a great storm arose out of due season, for seven days there was rainy weather, cold winds and overcast skies. Then Mucalinda, the serpent king, having come forth from his own haunt, having encircled the Lord’s body seven times with his coils, having spread a great hood over his head, stood saying: "Let no cold (annoy) the Lord, let no heat (annoy) the Lord, let not the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind and heat or creeping things (annoy) the Lord."</p>

<p><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.3.3"></a>Then Mucalinda, the serpent king, at the end of those seven days, having known that the sky was clear and without a cloud, having unwound his coils from the Lord’s body, having given up his own form and assumed a youth’s form, stood in front of the Lord honouring the Lord with joined palms.</p>

<hr>
<p><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.3.4"></a>Then the Lord, having understood this matter, at that time uttered this (solemn) utterance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="p18"><span class="parno">18</span><a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.5"></a>"Happy his solitude who glad at heart
<br>Hath dhamma learnt and doth the vision see!
<br>Happy is that benignity towards
<br>The world which on no creature worketh harm.</p>

<p id="p19"><span class="parno">19</span>Happy the absence of all lust, th’ ascent
<br>Past and beyond the needs of sense-desires.
<br>He who doth crush the great ‘I am’ conceit — 
<br>This, truly this, is happiness supreme."</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="endsutta"><span class="parno">20</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.3.5"></a>Told is the Talk at the Mucalinda.</p>

<h4>&nbsp;</h4>

<p id="p21"><span class="parno">21</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.4"></a><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.4.1"></a>Then the Lord, at the end of seven days, having emerged from that contemplation, approached the Rājāyata from the foot of the Mucalinda; having approached, he sat cross-legged in one (posture) for seven days at the foot of the Rājāyatana experiencing the bliss of freedom.</p>

<p><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.4.2"></a>Now<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.4"></a> at that time the merchants Tapussa and Bhallika were going along the high-road from Ukkalā to that district. Then a devatā who was a blood-relation of the merchants Tapussa and Bhallika spoke thus to the merchants Tapussa and Bhallika: "My good fellows, this Lord, having just (become) wholly awakened, is staying at the foot of the Rājāyatana, go and serve that Lord with barley-gruel and honey-balls, and this will be a blessing and happiness for you for a long time."</p>

<p id="p22"><span class="parno">22</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.4.3"></a>Then the merchants Tapussa and Bhallika, taking barley-gruel and honey-balls, approached the Lord; having approached, having greeted the Lord, they stood at a respectful distance. As they were standing at a respectful distance, the merchants Tapussa and Bhallika spoke thus to the Lord: "Lord, let the Lord receive our barley-gruel and honey-balls, that this may be a blessing and happiness for us for a long time."</p>

<p><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.4.4"></a>Then it occurred to the Lord: "Truth-finders do not <a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.6"></a> receive with their hands. Now with what shall I receive the barley-gruel and honey-balls?" Then the four Great Kings, knowing with their minds the reasoning in the Lord’s mind, from the four quarters presented the Lord with four bowls made of rock crystal, saying: "Lord, let the Lord receive the barley-gruel and honey-balls herein." The Lord received the barley-gruel and the honey-balls in a new bowl made of rock crystal, and having received them he partook of them.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p23"><span class="parno">23</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.4.5"></a>Then the merchants Tapussa and Bhallika, having found that the Lord had removed his hand from the bowl, having inclined their heads towards the Lord’s feet, spoke thus to the Lord: "We, Lord, are those going to the Lord for refuge and to dhamma; let the Lord accept us as lay-disciples gone for refuge for life from this day forth." Thus these came to be the first lay-disciples in the world using the two-word formula.</p>

<p class="endsutta"><span class="parno">24</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.4.6"></a>Told is the Talk at the Rājāyatana.</p>

<h4>&nbsp;</h4>

<p id="p25"><span class="parno">25</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.5"></a><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.5.1"></a>Then the Lord, having emerged from that contemplation at the end of seven days, approached the Goatherds’ Banyan from the foot of the Rājāyatana; having approached, the Lord stayed there at the foot of the Goatherds’ Banyan.</p>

<p>Then as the Lord was meditating in seclusion a reasoning arose in his mind thus: "This dhamma, won to by me, is deep, difficult to see, difficult to understand, peaceful, excellent, beyond dialectic, subtle, intelligible to the learned. But this is a creation delighting in sensual pleasure, delighted by sensual pleasure, rejoicing in sensual pleasure. So that for a creation delighting in sensual pleasure, delighted by sensual pleasure, rejoicing in sensual pleasure, this were a matter difficult to see,<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.5"></a> that is to say causal uprising by way of<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.7"></a> cause. This too were a matter very difficult to see, that is to say the calming of all the habitual tendencies, the renunciation of all attachment, the destruction of craving, dispassion, stopping, nibbāna. And so if I were to teach dhamma and others were not to understand me, this would be a weariness to me, this would be a vexation to me."</p>

<p>And further, these verses not heard before in the past occurred spontaneously to the Lord:

<br>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p id="p26"><span class="parno">26</span>"This that through many toils I’ve won — 
<br>Enough! Why should I make it known?
<br>By folk with lust and hate consumed
<br>This dhamma is not understood.</p>

<p id="p27"><span class="parno">27</span>Leading on against the stream,
<br>Subtle, deep, difficult to see, delicate,
<br>Unseen ‘twill be by passion’s slaves
<br>Cloaked in the murk of ignorance."</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>
<p id="p28"><span class="parno">28</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.5.4"></a>In such wise, as the Lord pondered, his mind inclined to little effort and not to teaching dhamma.</p>

<p id="p29"><span class="parno">29</span>Then it occurred to Brahmā Sahampati, knowing with his mind the reasoning in the Lord’s mind: "Alas, the world is lost, alas, the world is destroyed, inasmuch as the mind of the Truth-finder, the perfected one, the fully awakened one, inclines to little effort and not to teaching dhamma."</p>

<p>Then as a strong man might stretch forth his bent arm or might bend back his outstretched arm, even so did Brahmā Sahampati, vanishing from the Brahma-world, become manifest before the Lord.</p>

<p>Then Brahmā Sahampati, having arranged his upper robe<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.8"></a> over one shoulder, having stooped his right knee to the ground having saluted the Lord with joined palms, spoke thus to the Lord: "Lord, let the Lord teach dhamma, let the Well-farer teach dhamma; there are beings with little dust in their eyes who, not hearing dhamma, are decaying, (but if) they are learners of dhamma, they will grow."</p>

<p>Thus spoke Brahmā Sahampati; having said this, he further spoke thus:

<br>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p id="p30"><span class="parno">30</span>"There has appeared in Magadha before thee
<br>An unclean dhamma by impure minds devised.
<br>Open this door of deathlessness, let them hear
<br>Dhamma awakened to by the stainless one.</p>

<p id="p31"><span class="parno">31</span>"As on a crag on crest of mountain standing
<br>A man might watch the people far below,
<br>E’en so do thou, O Wisdom fair, ascending,
<br>O Seer of all, the terraced heights of truth,<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.6"></a>
<br>Look down, from grief released, upon the peoples
<br>Sunken in grief, oppressed with birth and age.</p>

<p id="p32"><span class="parno">32</span>"Arise, thou hero! Conqueror in the battle!
<br>Thou freed from debt! Man of the caravan!
<br>Walk the world over, let the Blessed One
<br>Teach dhamma. They who learn will grow."</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>
<p><span class="parno">33–36</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.5.8"></a>When he had spoken thus, the Lord spoke thus to Brahmā Sahampati: "Brahmā, it occurred to me: ‘This dhamma penetrated by me is deep … that would be a vexation to me.’ And further, Brahmā, these verses not heard before in the past occurred spontaneously to me: ‘This that through many toils I’ve won … cloaked in the murk of ignorance.’ In such wise, Brahmā, as I pondered, my mind inclined to little effort and not to teaching dhamma."</p>

<hr>
<p><span class="parno">37–44</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.5.9"></a>Then a second time did Brahmā Sahampati speak thus to the Lord: "Lord, let the Lord teach dhamma … if they are<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.9"></a> learners of dhamma, they will grow." Then a second time did the Lord speak thus to Brahmā Sahampati: "But, Brahmā, it occurred to me: … my mind inclined to little effort and and not to teaching dhamma."</p>

<hr>

<p><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.5.11"></a>Even as in a pond of blue lotuses or in a pond of red lotuses or in a pond of white lotuses, a few blue or red or white lotuses are born in the water, grow in the water, do not rise above the water but thrive while altogether immersed; a few blue or red or white lotuses are born in the water, grow in the water and reach to the surface of the water; a few blue or red or white lotuses are born in the water, grow in the water, and stand up rising out of the water, undefiled by the water.</p>

<p><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.6.6"></a>Then it occurred to the Lord: "But where is this group of five monks staying at present? Then the Lord with deva-vision, purified and surpassing that of men, saw the group of five monks staying near Benares at Isipatana in the deer-park. Then the Lord, having stayed at Uruvelā for as long as he found suiting, set out on tour for Benares.</p>

<p id="p56"><span class="parno">56</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.6.7"></a>Upaka, a Naked Ascetic, saw the Lord going along the highroad between Gayā and the (Tree of) Awakening; seeing him, he spoke thus to the Lord: "Your reverence, your sense-organs are quite pure, your complexion very bright, very clear.

<p><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.6.8"></a>When this had been said, the Lord addressed Upaka, the Naked Ascetic, in verses:</p>

<p id="p63"><span class="parno">63</span>When this had been said, Upaka, the Naked Ascetic, having said, "It may be (so), your reverence," having shaken his head, went off taking a different road.</p>

<p id="p64"><span class="parno">64</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.6.10"></a><a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.13"></a>Then the Lord, walking on tour, in due course approached Benares, the deer-park of Isipatana, the group of five monks. The group of five monks saw the Lord coming in the distance; seeing him, they agreed among themselves, saying: "Your reverences, this recluse Gotama is coming, he lives in abundance,<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.9"></a> he is wavering in his striving, he has reverted to a life of abundance. He should neither be greeted, nor stood up for, nor should his bowl and robe be received; all the same a seat may be put out, he can sit down if he wants to."</p>

<p><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.6.11"></a>But as the Lord gradually approached this group of five monks, so this group of five monks, not adhering to their own agreement, having gone towards the Lord, one received his bowl and robe, one made ready a seat, one brought water for washing the feet, a foot-stool, a foot-stand. The Lord sat down on the seat made ready, and the Lord, while he was sitting down, washed his feet. Further, they addressed the Lord by name and with the epithet of "your reverence."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p65"><span class="parno">65</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.6.12"></a>When this had been said, the Lord spoke thus to the group of five monks: "Do not, monks, address a Truthfinder by name, and with the epithet ‘your reverence’. A Truthfinder, monks, is a perfected one, a fully awakened one. Give ear, monks, the deathless has been found; <i>I</i> instruct, <i>I</i> teach dhamma. Going along in accordance with what has been enjoined, having soon realised here and now by your own super-knowledge that supreme goal of the Brahma-faring for the sake of which young men of family rightly go forth from home into homelessness, you will abide in it."</p>

<p><a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.14"></a>When this had been said, the group of five monks spoke thus to the Lord: "But you, reverend Gotama, did not come to a state of further-men, to the eminence of truly <i>ariyan</i> vision of knowledge, by this conduct, by this course, by this practice of austerities. So how can you now come to a state of further-men, to the eminence of the truly <i>ariyan</i> vision of knowledge, when you live in abundance, are wavering in striving, and have reverted to a life of abundance?"</p>

<p>When this had been said, the Lord spoke thus to the group of five monks: "A Truthfinder, monks, does not live in abundance, he does not waver in striving, he does not revert to a life of abundance.

<hr>
<p id="p66"><span class="parno">66</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.6.15"></a>And a second time did the group of five monks speak thus to the Lord … And a second time did the Lord speak thus to the group of five monks … And a third time did the group of five monks speak thus to the Lord:<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.10"></a> "But you, reverend Gotama, did not come to a state of further-men … by this practice of austerities … to a life of abundance?"</p>

<hr>
<p id="p67"><span class="parno">67</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.6.16"></a>When this had been said, the Lord spoke thus to the group of five monks: "Do you allow, monks, that I have never spoken to you like this before?"</p>

<hr>
<p>"You have not, Lord."</p>

<p>"A Truthfinder, monks, is a perfected one, a fully awakened one. Give ear … you will abide in it." And the Lord was able to convince the group of five monks. Then the group of five monks listened to the Lord again, gave ear to him and aroused their minds for profound knowledge.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p68"><span class="parno">68</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.6.17"></a><a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.15"></a>Then the Lord addressed the group of five monks, saying:</p>

Now, monks, without adopting either of these two (dead) ends, there is a middle course, fully awakened to by the Truthfinder, making for vision, making for knowledge, which conduces to calming, to super-knowledge, to awakening, to nibbāna.</p>

Being ministered to by bands of female musicians for four months in the mansion for the rains, he did not come down from that mansion. Then while Yasa, the young man of family, was possessed of and provided with the five kinds of sense-pleasures, and was being ministered to, he fell asleep first and his suite fell asleep after him, and an oil lamp was burning all through the night.</p>

<p>Then Yasa, the young man of family, having awoken first saw his own suite sleeping, one with a lute in the hollow of her arm, one with a tabor at her neck, one with a drum in the hollow of her arm, one with dishevelled hair, one with saliva dripping from her mouth, muttering in their sleep, like a cemetery before his very eyes. Seeing this, its peril grew plain, and his mind was set on disregarding it. Then Yasa, the young man of family, uttered a solemn utterance: "What distress indeed, what affliction indeed."</p>

<p id="p108"><span class="parno">108</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.7.3"></a>Then Yasa, the young man of family, having put on his golden sandals, approached the door of the dwelling. Non-human beings opened the door, thinking: "Let there be no obstacle for the going forth from home into homelessness of Yasa, the young man of family." Then Yasa, the young man of family, approached the city-door. Non-human beings opened the door, thinking: "Let there be no obstacle for the going forth from home into homelessness of Yasa, the young man of family." Then Yasa, the young man of family, approached the deer-park at Isipatana.</p>

<p id="p109"><span class="parno">109</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.7.4"></a>At that time, the Lord having risen in the night towards dawn, was pacing up and down in the open air. The Lord saw Yasa, the young man of family, coming in the distance: seeing him, having come down from (the place) where he was pacing up and down, he sat down on an appointed seat. Then Yasa, the young man of family, when he was near, uttered this solemn utterance to the Lord: "What distress indeed, what affliction<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.23"></a> indeed." Then the Lord spoke thus to Yasa, the young man of family: "This, Yasa, is not distress, this, Yasa, is not affliction. Come, sit down, Yasa, I will teach you dhamma."</p>

<p>Then Yasa, the young man of family, thinking: "It is said that this is not distress, that this is not affliction", exultant and uplifted, having taken off his golden sandals, approached the Lord; having approached, having greeted the Lord, he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

<p id="p110"><span class="parno">110</span>As he was sitting down at a respectful distance, the Lord talked a progressive talk to Yasa, the young man of family, that is to say, talk on giving, talk on moral habit, talk on heaven, he explained the peril, the vanity, the depravity of pleasures of the senses, the advantage in renouncing them.</p>

<p><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.7.6"></a>When the Lord<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.16"></a> knew that the mind of Yasa, the young man of family, was ready, malleable, devoid of hindrances, uplifted, pleased, then he explained to him the teaching on dhamma which the awakened ones have themselves discovered: ill, uprising, stopping, the Way. And just as a clean cloth without black specks will take a dye easily, even so (as he was sitting) on that very seat, dhamma-vision, dustless, stainless, arose to Yasa, the young man of family, that whatever is of a nature to uprise, all that is of a nature to stop."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p111"><span class="parno">111</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.7.7"></a>Then the mother of Yasa, the young man of family, having mounted up to the mansion, not seeing Yasa, the young man of family, approached the (great) merchant, the householder; having approached she spoke thus to the (great) merchant, the householder; "Householder, your son, Yasa, is not to be seen." Then the (great) merchant, the householder, having dispatched messengers on horse-back to the four quarters, himself approached the deer-park at Isipatana. The (great) merchant, the householder, saw the prints of golden sandals, and seeing them he followed them along.</p>

<p><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.7.8"></a>The Lord saw the (great) merchant, the householder, coming<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.24"></a> in the distance; seeing him, it occurred to the Lord: "Suppose I were to perform such a psychic wonder that the (great) merchant, the householder, sitting here, should not see Yasa the young man of family, sitting here?" Then the Lord performed such a psychic wonder.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p112"><span class="parno">112</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.7.9"></a>Then the (great) merchant, the householder, approached the Lord; having approached he spoke thus to the Lord: "Lord has the Lord not seen Yasa, the young man of family?"</p>

<p id="p113"><span class="parno">113</span>"Well, householder, sit down. Perhaps, sitting here, you may see Yasa, the young man of family, sitting here."</p>

<p>Then the (great) merchant, the householder, thinking: "It is said that I, sitting here, will see Yasa, the young man of family, sitting here", and exultant, uplifted, having greeted the Lord, he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

<hr>
<p><span class="parno">114–115</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.7.10"></a>As the (great) merchant, the householder was sitting down at a respectful distance, the Lord talked a progressive talk … attained without the help of another to full confidence in the teacher’s instruction, spoke thus to the Lord: "Excellent, Lord! Excellent, Lord! Just as one might set upright what has been upset, or might uncover what was concealed, or might show the way to one who is astray, or might bring an oil lamp into the darkness, thinking, ‘Those with eyes may see shapes’, even so is dhamma explained in many a figure by the Lord. I myself go to the Lord as refuge, to dhamma, and to the Order of monks. Let the Lord accept me as a lay-disciple gone for refuge from this day forth for as long as life lasts." Thus he came to be the first lay-disciple in the world<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.17"></a> using the three-word formula.</p>

<p id="p116"><span class="parno">116</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.7.11"></a>Then while the father of Yasa, the young man of family, was being taught dhamma, as he was reviewing his stage (of knowledge) as it was seen, as it was known, his mind was freed from the cankers without grasping. Then it occurred to the Lord: "While the father of Yasa, the young man of family, was being taught dhamma, as he was reviewing his stage (of knowledge) as it was seen, as it was known, his mind was freed from the cankers without grasping. Now Yasa, the<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.25"></a> young man of family, cannot become one, having turned back to the low life, to enjoy pleasures of the senses as he did formerly when leading a household life. Suppose I were to annul that psychic wonder?" Then the Lord annulled that psychic wonder.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p117"><span class="parno">117</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.7.12"></a>Then the (great) merchant, the householder, saw Yasa, the young man of family sitting down; seeing him, he spoke thus to Yasa, the young man of family: "Dear Yasa, your mother is full of lamentation and grief, give your mother life."</p>

<p>Then Yasa, the young man of family, looked towards the Lord. Then the Lord spoke thus to the (great) merchant, the householder: "What do you think about this, house-holder, that dhamma was seen by Yasa with a learner’s knowledge, with a learner’s insight, even as by you? As he was reviewing his stage (of knowledge), as it was seen, as it was known, his mind was freed from the cankers without grasping. Now can Yasa, householder, having turned back to the low life, become one to enjoy pleasures of the senses, as he did formerly when leading a household life?"</p>

<p>"No, Lord."</p>

<p>"Dhamma was seen by Yasa, the young man of family, householder, with a learner’s knowledge, with a learner’s insight, even as by you. As he was reviewing his stage (of knowledge), as it was seen, as it was known, his mind was freed from the cankers without grasping. Now Yasa, the young man of family, householder, cannot become one, having turned back to the low life, to enjoy pleasures of the senses, as he did formerly when leading a household life."</p>

<p>"Lord, it is a gain for Yasa, the young man of family, Lord, it is well gotten for Yasa, the young man of family, inasmuch as the mind of Yasa, the young man of family, is freed from the cankers without grasping. Lord, may the Lord consent to a meal with me on the morrow with Yasa, the young man of family, as his attendant?" The Lord consented by becoming silent.</p>

<p id="p118"><span class="parno">118</span>Then the (great) merchant, the householder, knowing that the Lord had consented, rising from his seat, having greeted the Lord, departed keeping his right side towards him.</p>

<p><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.7.15"></a>Then Yasa, the young man of family, soon after the (great)<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.26"></a> merchant, the householder, had departed, spoke thus to the Lord: "Lord, may I receive the going forth in the Lord’s presence, may I receive ordination?"</p>

<p>"Come, monk," the Lord said, "well preached is dhamma. Lead the Brahma-faring for making an utter end of ill." So this<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.18"></a> came to be that venerable one’s ordination. At that time there were seven perfected ones in the world.</p>

<p id="p120"><span class="parno">120</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.8"></a><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.8.1"></a>Then the Lord, having dressed in the morning, taking his bowl and robe, approached the dwelling of the (great) merchant, the householder, with the venerable Yasa as attendant; having approached, he sat down on an appointed seat. Then the mother and the former wife of the venerable Yasa approached the Lord; having approached, having greeted the Lord, they sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

<p id="p121"><span class="parno">121</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.8.2"></a>The Lord talked a progressive talk to these, that is to say, talk on giving, talk on moral habit, talk on heaven … dhamma-vision, dustless, stainless, arose to them that, "whatever is of a nature to uprise, all that is of a nature to stop."</p>

<p><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.8.3"></a>These, having seen dhamma, attained dhamma … spoke thus to the Lord: "Excellent Lord! … we ourselves, Lord, go to the Lord as refuge, to dhamma and to the Order of monks. Let the Lord accept us as women lay-disciples, gone for refuge from this day forth for as long as life lasts." Thus these were the first women lay-disciples in the world using the three-word formula.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p122"><span class="parno">122</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.8.4"></a>Then the venerable Yasa’s mother and father and former wife, having with their own hand(s) served the Lord and the venerable Yasa and having offered them sumptuous foods, solid and soft, sat down when the Lord had finished his meal and had removed his hand from the bowl. Then the Lord, having gladdened, roused, rejoiced, delighted the venerable Yasa’s mother and father and former wife with talk on dhamma, rising from his seat departed.</p>

<p id="p123"><span class="parno">123</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.9"></a><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.9.1"></a>Four householder friends of the venerable Yasa, young men of families of (great) merchants and lesser (great) merchants<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.27"></a> in Benares, Vimala,<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.19"></a> Subāhu, Puṇṇaji, Gavampati, heard: "They say that Yasa, the young man of family, having cut off his hair and beard, having put on yellow robes, has gone forth from home into homelessness." Having heard this, it occurred to them: "Now this can be no ordinary dhamma and discipline, nor can this be an ordinary going forth, in that Yasa, the young man of family, having cut off his hair and beard, having put on the yellow robes, has gone forth from home into homelessness."</p>

<p id="p124"><span class="parno">124</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.9.2"></a>These four people approached the venerable Yasa; having approached, having greeted the venerable Yasa, they stood at a respectful distance. Then the venerable Yasa, taking these four householder friends, approached the Lord; having approached, having greeted the Lord, he sat down at a respectful distance. As he was sitting down at a respectful distance, the venerable Yasa spoke thus to the Lord: "These four householder friends of mine, Lord, young men of families of (great) merchants and lesser (great) merchants in Benares, Vimala, Subāhu, Puṇṇaji, Gavampati, may the Lord exhort, may he instruct these four."</p>

<p id="p125"><span class="parno">125</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.9.3"></a>The Lord talked a progressive talk to these, that is to say, talk on giving, talk on moral habit, talk on heaven … dhamma-vision, dustless, stainless, arose to them that "whatever is of the nature to uprise, all that is of the nature to stop."</p>

<p>"Come, monks," the Lord said, "well preached is dhamma, fare the Brahma-faring for making an utter end of ill." So this came to be these venerable ones’ ordination. Then the Lord exhorted, instructed these monks with dhamma talk. While they were being exhorted, instructed by the Lord with dhamma talk, their minds were freed from the cankers without grasping.

Let not two (of you) go by one (way.) Monks, teach dhamma which is lovely at the beginning, lovely in the middle, lovely at the ending. Explain with the spirit and the letter the Brahma-faring completely fulfilled, wholly pure. There are beings with little dust in their eyes, who, not hearing dhamma, are decaying, (but) if they are learners of dhamma, they will grow.

<p id="p157"><span class="parno">157</span>And a second time the Lord spoke thus to the matted hair ascetic Kassapa of Uruvelā: "If it is not inconvenient to you … "</p>

<hr>
<p id="p158"><span class="parno">158</span>And a third time the Lord spoke thus to the matted hair ascetic Kassapa of Uruvelā: "If it is not inconvenient to you, Kassapa, let me stay for one night in the fire-room."</p>

<p>"It is not inconvenient to me, great recluse, (but) there is a fierce serpent king of psychic power there; he is a terribly venomous snake. Do not let him harm you."</p>

<p>"It is not likely that he can harm me. Please do you, Kassapa, allow (me the use of) the fire-room,"</p>

<p>"Stay, great recluse, as you wish it."</p>

<p>Then the Lord, having entered the fire-room, having laid down a grass mat, sat down cross-legged, keeping his back erect, having caused mindfulness to be present in front of him.</p>

<p id="p159"><span class="parno">159</span>Then that serpent saw that the Lord had entered, and seeing this, pained, afflicted, he blew forth smoke. Then it occurred to the Lord: "What now if I, without destroying this serpent’s<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.25"></a> skin and hide and flesh and ligaments and bones and the marrow of the bones, were to master (his) heat by heat?"</p>

<p>Then the Lord, having worked a work of psychic power, blew forth smoke. Then that serpent, not conquering anger, blazed up. The Lord, having attained the condition of heat, also blazed up. When both were in flames, the fire-room became as though burning, ablaze, in flames. Then the matted hair ascetics, having surrounded the fire-room, spoke thus:<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.34"></a> "Beautiful indeed is the great recluse, (but) he will be harmed by the serpent."</p>

<p>Then the Lord at the end of that night, without having destroyed that serpent’s skin and hide and flesh and ligaments and bones and the marrow of the bones, having mastered (his) heat by heat, having placed him in his bowl, showed him to the matted hair ascetic, Uruvelākassapa, saying: "This, Kassapa, is your serpent, his heat was mastered by heat." Then it occurred to the matted hair ascetic Uruvelākassapa: "Truly the great recluse is of great psychic power, of great majesty, in that he can master by heat the heat of the fierce serpent king who has psychic power and is a terribly venomous snake; but yet he is not a perfected one as I am."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p160" class="verse"><span class="parno">160</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.15.6"></a>Near the Nerañjarā, the Lord
<br>spoke thus to the matted hair ascetic Uruvelākassapa:

<p id="p161" class="verse"><span class="parno">161</span>"It is not inconvenient to me, great recluse,

<p id="p162" class="verse"><span class="parno">162</span>"It is not likely that he can harm me.
<br>Please do you, Kassapa, allow (me the use of) the fire-room."
<br>"It is given"; having understood this,
<br>the fearless one entered, fear overpassed.</p>

<p id="p163" class="verse"><span class="parno">163</span>Having seen that the holy man had entered,
<br>the chief of snakes, afflicted, blew forth smoke.
<br>The chief of men, joyful, unperturbed,
<br>blew forth smoke there<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.35"></a> too.</p>

<p id="p164" class="verse"><span class="parno">164</span>But the chief of snakes, not conquering anger,
<br>blazed up like a fire.
<br>The chief of men, highly proficient in the condition of heat,
<br>blazed up there too.</p>

<p id="p165" class="verse"><span class="parno">165</span>When both were in flames,
<br>the matted hair ascetics, as they were looking at the fire-room, said:

<br>(but) he will be harmed by the serpent."</p>

<p id="p166" class="verse"><span class="parno">166</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.15.7"></a>Then at the end of that night
<br>the serpent’s flames became extinguished,
<br>but the multicoloured flames of him of psychic power remained,</p>

<p id="p167" class="verse"><span class="parno">167</span>and multicoloured flames, dark green,
<br>then red, crimson, yellow and crystal-coloured

<p id="p169"><span class="parno">169</span>Then the matted hair ascetic Uruvelakassapa, thoroughly believing in this wonder of psychic power of the Lord, spoke thus to the Lord: "Stay just here, great recluse, I (can offer you) a constant supply of food."</p>

<p id="p172"><span class="parno">172</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.16.2"></a>Then the matted hair ascetic Uruvelakassapa approached the Lord at the end of that night, and having approached he spoke thus to the Lord: "It is time, great recluse, the meal is ready.

<p>"Kassapa, these were the four Great Kings who approached me in order to hear dhamma."</p>

Then at the end of that night the matted hair ascetic Uruvelakassapa approached the Lord; having approached, he spoke thus to the Lord: "It is time, great recluse, the meal is ready. But why did you not come yesterday, great recluse? We thought of you however, saying‘How is it that the great recluse does not come?’ A portion of solid food and soft food was put aside for you."</p>

<p id="p183"><span class="parno">183</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.20"></a><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.20.1"></a>Now at that time a rag-robe accrued to the Lord. Then it occurred to the Lord: "Now where can I wash the rag-robe?" Then Sakka, lord of the <i>devas</i>, knowing by mind the reasoning in the Lord’s mind, having dug a tank with his hand, spoke thus to the Lord: "Lord, the Lord may wash the rag-robe here." Then it occurred to the Lord: "Now on what can I knead the rag-robe?" Then Sakka, lord of the <i>devas</i>, knowing by mind the reasoning in the Lord’s mind, having<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.38"></a> put down a large stone near him, said: "Lord, the Lord may knead the rag-robe here."</p>

<p>Then it occurred to the Lord: "Now holding on to what can I come up from (the water)?"

Then it occurred to the Lord: "Now on what can I stretch out the rag-robe?" Then Sakka, lord of the <i>devas</i>, knowing by mind the reasoning in the Lord’s mind, having put down a large stone near him said: "Lord, the Lord may stretch out the rag-robe here"</p>

<p id="p184"><span class="parno">184</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.20.3"></a>Then the matted hair ascetic Uruvelakassapa approached the Lord at the end of that night; having approached, he spoke thus to the Lord: "It is time, great recluse, the meal is ready.

<p>"Kassapa, a rag-robe accrued to me here, and this occurred to me, Kassapa, ‘Now where can I wash the rag-robe? ‘Then, Kassapa, Sakka, lord of the <i>devas</i>, knowing by mind the reasoning in my mind, having dug a tank with his hand, spoke thus to me: ‘Lord, the Lord may wash the rag-robe here.’ So this tank was dug by the hand of a non-human being.

<p>Then this occurred to me, Kassapa, ‘Now holding on to what can I come up out of (the water)?’ Then, Kassapa, a devatā … said: ‘Lord, the Lord may come up from (the water) holding on here.’ So this <i>kakudha</i> (tree) was a hold for my hand.

<p id="p185"><span class="parno">185</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.20.7"></a>Then the matted hair ascetic Uruvelakassapa approached the Lord at the end of that night; having approached,<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.30"></a> he announced the time to the Lord, saying: "It is time, great recluse, the meal is ready."</p>

<p>"You go on, Kassapa, I am coming along," and having dismissed the matted hair ascetic Uruvelakassapa, having plucked a fruit from a rose-apple tree, after which this Land of the Rose-apples is named, he sat down in the fire-room, having arrived first.</p>

<p>The matted hair ascetic Uruvelakassapa saw the Lord sitting in the fire-room; seeing him he spoke thus to the Lord: "By what way have you come, great recluse? I set out before you, but you are sitting in the fire-room, having arrived first."</p>

<p>"Now I, Kassapa, having dismissed you, having plucked a fruit from a rose-apple tree, after which this Land of the Rose-apples is named, am sitting in the fire-room, having arrived first.

<p>"No, great recluse, you alone are worthy of it, you alone eat it."

<p>"You go on, Kassapa, I am coming along," and having dismissed the matted hair ascetic Uruvelakassapa, and having plucked a mango fruit not far from the rose-apple tree, after which this Land of the Rose-apples is named … having plucked a fruit of emblic myrobalan not far from the mango tree … having plucked a fruit of yellow myrobalan not far from the emblic myrobalan, having gone to the Thirty, having plucked a flower from the Coral Tree, he sat down in the fire-room, having arrived first. The matted hair ascetic Uruvelakassapa saw the Lord sitting in the fire-room, and seeing him he spoke thus to the Lord: "By what way have you come, great recluse?

<hr>
<p>"Now I, Kassapa, having dismissed you, having gone to the Thirty, having plucked a flower from the Coral Tree, am sitting in the fire-room, having arrived first. Truly, Kassapa, this flower of the Coral Tree is full of colour, full of scent; if you like, do take it."</p>

<p>"No, great recluse, you alone are worthy of it, you alone <a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.31"></a>take it."

Then the Lord spoke thus to the matted hair ascetic Uruvelakassapa: "Kassapa, let sticks be chopped."</p>

<p>"Let them be chopped, great recluse." Five hundred sticks were chopped simultaneously. Then it occurred to the matted hair ascetic Uruvelakassapa: "Truly the great recluse is of great psychic power, of great might, in that also sticks are chopped; but yet he is not a perfected one as I am."</p>

<p id="p188"><span class="parno">188</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.20.13"></a>Now at that time these matted hair ascetics, wanting to tend the (sacred) fires, were unable to kindle the fires.

<p>"Let them be kindled, great recluse." Five hundred fires were kindled simultaneously … " … in that also the fires are kindled; but yet he is not a perfected one as I am."</p>

<p id="p189"><span class="parno">189</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.20.15"></a>Now at that time on the cold winter nights between the eights in a time of snowfall these matted hair ascetics were plunging into the river Nerañjarā, then emerging and repeatedly<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.42"></a> plunging in and out. Then the Lord created as many as five hundred fire-vessels just where these matted hair ascetics, having come up from (the river), warmed themselves.<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.32"></a> Then it occurred to these matted hair ascetics: "Doubtless it is (owing to) the psychic might of the great recluse that these fire-vessels are created." Then it occurred to the matted hair ascetic Uruvelakassapa: "Truly the great recluse is of great psychic power, of great might, in that he can create these fire-vessels; but yet he is not a perfected one as I am."</p>

<p id="p190"><span class="parno">190</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.20.16"></a>Now at that time a great rain fell out of the proper season, and a great flood resulted. The Lord was staying in a place which became inundated by water. Then it occurred to the Lord: "Now suppose that I, having made the water recede all round, should pace up and down in the middle on dust-covered ground?" Then the Lord, having made the water recede all round, paced up and down in the middle on dust-covered ground. Then the matted hair ascetic Uruvelakassapa, thinking: "I hope that the great recluse has not been carried away by the water," went together with a boat and many matted hair ascetics to that place where the Lord was staying. The matted hair ascetic Uruvelakassapa saw the Lord who, having made the water recede all round, was pacing up and down in the middle on dust-covered ground, and seeing him he spoke thus to the Lord: "Is it indeed you who are here, great recluse?"</p>

<p id="p191"><span class="parno">191</span>"It is I, Kassapa," and the Lord having risen up above the ground, placed himself in the boat. Then it occurred to the matted hair ascetic Uruvelakassapa: "Truly the great recluse is of great psychic power, of great might, in that also the water does not carry him away; but yet he is not a perfected one as I am."</p>

<p>Then it occurred to the Lord: "Now, for a long time it will occur to this foolish man, ‘Truly the great recluse is of<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.43"></a> great psychic power, of great might; but yet he is not a perfected one as I am.’ Now, suppose I should deeply stir this matted hair ascetic?" Then the Lord spoke thus to the matted hair ascetic Kassapa of Uruvelā: "Neither are you, Kassapa, a perfected one nor have you entered on the way to perfection, and that course is not for you by which you either could be a perfected one or could have entered on the way to perfection." Then the matted hair ascetic Kassapa of Uruvelā, having inclined his head to the Lord’s feet, spoke thus to the Lord: "Lord, may I receive the going forth in the Lord’s presence, may I receive ordination?"</p>

<p id="p192"><span class="parno">192</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.20.18"></a>"It is you, Kassapa, who are leader, guide, highest, chief, head of five hundred matted hair ascetics; do consult these so that they can do what they think (right)."

<hr>
<p>"For a long time we, good sir, have been much pleased by the great recluse; if, revered sir, you will fare the Brahma-faring under the great recluse, all of us will fare the Brahma-faring under the great recluse."</p>

<p id="p193"><span class="parno">193</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.20.19"></a>Then these matted hair ascetics, having let their hair, their braids, their bundles on the carrying-poles, their implements for fire-worship be carried away all mixed up in the water, approached the Lord; having approached, having inclined their heads to the Lord’s feet, they spoke thus to the Lord: "Lord, may we receive the going forth in the Lord’s presence, may we receive ordination?"</p>

<p>"Come, monks," the Lord said, "well taught is dhamma fare the Brahma-faring for making an utter end of ill." So this came to be these venerable ones’ ordination.</p>

<hr>
<p>"Yes, friend, this is better."</p>

<p>Then these matted hair ascetics, having let their hair, their braids, their bundles on the carrying-poles, their implements for fire-worship be carried away all mixed up in the water, approached the Lord; having approached,<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.34"></a> having inclined their heads to the Lord’s feet, they spoke thus to the Lord: "Lord, may we receive the going forth in the Lord’s presence, may we receive ordination?"</p>

<p id="p196"><span class="parno">196</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.20.24"></a>Through the Lord’s psychic resolution, five hundred fire-sticks could not be chopped, (and) were chopped; fires could not be kindled (and) were kindled; could not be extinguished<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.45"></a> (and) were extinguished; five hundred fire-vessels were created.

<p id="p197"><span class="parno">197</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.21"></a><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.21.1"></a>Then the Lord, having stayed at Uruvelā for as long as he found suiting, set out on tour for Gayā Head together with a large Order of monks, with all those same thousand monks who had formerly been matted hair ascetics. Then the Lord stayed near Gayā at Gayā Head together with the thousand monks.</p>

<p id="p198"><span class="parno">198</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.21.2"></a>And there the Lord addressed the monks, saying: "Monks, everything is burning. And what, monks, is everything that is burning? The eye, monks, is burning, material shapes are burning, consciousness through the eye is burning, impingement on the eye is burning, in other words the feeling which arises from impingement on the eye, be it pleasant or painful or neither painful nor pleasant, that too is burning. With what is it burning? I say it is burning with the fire of passion, with the fire of hatred, with the fire of stupidity; it is burning because of birth, ageing, dying, because of grief, sorrow, suffering, lamentation and despair.</p>

<p>"The ear is burning, sounds are burning … the nose is burning, odours are burning … the tongue is burning, tastes are burning … the body is burning, tangible objects are burning … the mind is burning, mental states are burning, consciousness through the mind is burning, impingement on the mind is burning, in other words the feeling which raises through impingement on the mind, be it pleasant or painful or neither painful nor pleasant, that too is burning. With what is it burning? I say it is burning with the fire of passion, with the fire of hatred, with the fire of stupidity; it is burning because of birth, ageing, dying, because of grief, sorrow, suffering, lamentation and despair.</p>

<p id="p199"><span class="parno">199</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.21.4"></a>"Seeing this, monks, the instructed disciple of the ariyans disregards the eye and he disregards material shapes and he<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.46"></a> disregards consciousness through the eye and he disregards impingement on the eye, in other words the feeling which arises from impingement on the eye, be it pleasant or painful or neither painful nor pleasant, that too he disregards. And he disregards the ear and he disregards sounds, and he disregards the nose<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.35"></a> and he disregards odours, and he disregards the tongue and he disregards tastes, and he disregards the body and he disregards tangible objects, and he disregards the mind and he disregards mental states and he disregards consciousness through the mind and he disregards impingement on the mind, in other words the feeling that arises from impingement on the mind, be it pleasant or painful or neither painful nor pleasant, that too he disregards; disregarding, he is dispassionate; through dispassion he is freed; in freedom the knowledge comes to be, ‘I am freed’, and he comprehends: Destroyed is birth, lived is the Brahma-faring, done is what was to be done, there is no more of being such or such."</p>

<p id="p200"><span class="parno">200</span>And while this discourse was being uttered, the minds of these thousand monks were freed from the cankers without grasping.</p>

<h4>&nbsp;</h4>

<p id="p202"><span class="parno">202</span>Then the Lord, having stayed at Gayā Head for as long as he found suiting, set out on tour for Rājagaha together with the large Order of monks, with all those same thousand monks who had formerly been matted hair ascetics. Then the Lord, walking on tour, in due course arrived at Rājagaha. The Lord stayed there at Rājagaha in the Palm Grove pleasure ground in the Supatiṭṭha shrine.</p>

<p>Then King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha heard: "Verily, the recluse Gotama, the son of the Sakyans, who has gone forth from the Sakyan clan, has reached Rājagaha and is<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.47"></a> staying at Rājagaha in the Palm Grove pleasure ground in the Supatiṭṭha shrine. A lovely reputation has gone forth concerning the Lord Gotama, thus: He is indeed Lord, perfected one, fully awakened one, endowed with knowledge and conduct, well-farer, knower of the worlds, unrivalled charioteer of men to be tamed, teacher of devas and mankind, awakened one, Lord. Having realised them by his own super-knowledge, he makes known this world with its <i>devas</i>, with its Māras, with its Brahmās, creatures with devas and men, with recluses and brahmans. He teaches dhamma, lovely at the beginning, lovely in the middle, lovely at the ending. He explains with the spirit and the letter the Brahma-faring completely fulfilled and wholly pure. Good indeed it were to see perfected ones like this."</p>

<p id="p203"><span class="parno">203</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.22.3"></a>Then King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha, surrounded by twelve myriad brahmans and householders of Magadha, approached the Lord; having approached, having greeted the Lord, he sat down at a respectful distance. Then some of these twelve myriad<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.36"></a> brahmans and householders of Magadha having greeted the Lord, sat down at a respectful distance; some exchanged greetings with the Lord, and having exchanged greetings of friendliness and courtesy, they sat down at a respectful distance; some having saluted the Lord with joined palms, sat down at a respectful distance; some having shouted out their name and clan before the Lord, sat down at a respectful distance; some having become silent, sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

<p>Then it occurred to those twelve myriad brahmans and householders of Magadha: "Now, does the great recluse fare the Brahma-faring under Kassapa of Uruvelā, or does Kassapa of Uruvelā fare the Brahma-faring under the great recluse?" Then the Lord, knowing with his mind the reasoning in the minds of those twelve myriad brahmans and householders of Magadha, addressed Kassapa of Uruvelā with the verses:</p>

<p id="p204" class="verse"><span class="parno">204</span><a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.48"></a>"What hast thou seen, O dweller in Uruvelā,
<br>That thou, known as emaciate, hast abandoned the (sacred) fire?
<br>I ask thee about this matter, Kassapa:
<br>Hast thou abandoned thy fire-implements?"</p>

<p id="p205" class="verse"><span class="parno">205</span>‘‘The sacrifices speak of forms and sounds,
<br>Also of tastes, pleasures and women.
<br>Knowing that ‘This is dross’ among affections — 
<br>Therefore I delighted not in sacrifice, in offering."</p>

<p id="p206" class="verse"><span class="parno">206</span><a class="pts__pn" id="Kd.1.22.5"></a>"But if your mind delights not there, Kassapa," the Lord said,
<br>"Among forms, sounds and also tastes,
<br>Then in the world of devas and men what does your mind delight in?
<br>Kassapa, tell me that."</p>

<p id="p207" class="verse"><span class="parno">207</span>"When I had seen the path, peaceful, without substrate,
<br>Stainless, not attached to sensations’ becoming,
<br>Not becoming otherwise, where one cannot be led by others — 
<br>In consequence, I delighted not in sacrifice, in offering."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p208"><span class="parno">208</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.22.6"></a>Then the venerable Kassapa of Uruvelā, rising from his seat, having arranged his upper robe over one shoulder, having inclined his head towards the Lord’s feet, spoke thus to the Lord: "Lord, the Lord is my teacher, I am a disciple; Lord, the Lord is my teacher, I am a disciple.’’ Then it occurred to those twelve myriad Brahmāns and householders of Magadha: "Kassapa of Uruvelā fares the Brahma-faring under the great recluse."</p>

<p>Then the Lord, knowing by mind the reasoning in the minds of these twelve myriad Brahmāns and householders of Magadha,<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.49"></a><a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.37"></a> talked a progressive talk … stopping, the Way.</p>

<hr>
<p>And as a clean cloth without black specks will easily take a dye, even so as the twelve myriad Brahmans and householders of Magadha with Bimbisāra at their head were (sitting) in those very seats, dhamma-vision, dustless, stainless, arose to them, that "Whatever is of the nature to uprise, all that is of the nature to stop," and one myriad declared themselves to be lay-followers.</p>

<p id="p209"><span class="parno">209</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.22.9"></a>Then King Bimbisāra of Magadha, having seen dhamma, attained dhamma, known dhamma, plunged into dhamma, having crossed over doubt, put away uncertainty, having attained without another’s help to full confidence in the teacher’s instruction, spoke thus to the Lord: "Formerly, Lord, when I was a young man I had five ambitions. These are now realised by me. Formerly, Lord, when I was a young man it occurred to me: ‘Might I be anointed into kingship.’ This was my first ambition, Lord. It has now been realised by me. And ‘Might the perfected one, the fully awakened one come into my realm.’ This, Lord, was my second ambition. It has now been realised by me.</p>

<p>"‘That I might pay homage to this Lord.’ This, Lord, was my third ambition. It has now been realised by me. And ‘May that Lord teach me dhamma.’ This, Lord, was my fourth ambition. It has now been realised by me. And ‘Might I understand that Lord’s dhamma.’ This, Lord, was my fifth ambition. It has now been realised by me. Formerly, Lord, when I was a young man I had these five ambitions. They are now realised by me.</p>

<p>"Excellent, Lord! Excellent, Lord! Even, Lord, as one might set upright what has been upset … even so is dhamma explained in many a figure by the Lord. So I, Lord, go to the Lord as refuge and to dhamma and to the Order of monks. Lord, may the Lord accept me as a lay-disciple gone for refuge from this day forth for as long as life lasts. And, Lord, may the Lord consent<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.38"></a> to a meal with me to-morrow together with the Order of monks." The Lord consented by becoming silent.</p>

<p><a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.50"></a>Then King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha, having understood the Lord’s consent, rising from his seat, having greeted the Lord, departed keeping his right side towards him. Then King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha, having had sumptuous food, solid and soft, prepared, at the end of that night had the time announced to the Lord, saying: "Lord, it is time, the meal is ready."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p210"><span class="parno">210</span>Then the Lord, having dressed in the morning, taking his bowl and robe, entered Rājagaha together with the large Order of monks, with all those same thousand monks who had formerly been matted-hair ascetics.</p>

<p>Now at that time Sakka, lord of the <i>devas</i>, having assumed the form of a Brahman youth, walked in front of the Order of monks with the Lord at its head, singing these verses:</p>

<blockquote>
<p id="p211"><span class="parno">211</span>"The tamed with the tamed,
<br>with the former matted-hair ascetics,
<br>the well freed with the well freed,
<br>The Lord, beautifully coloured like a golden ornament,
<br>entered Rājagaha.</p>

<p id="p212"><span class="parno">212</span>The freed with the freed,
<br>with the former matted-hair ascetics,
<br>the well freed with the well freed,
<br>The Lord, beautifully coloured like a golden ornament,
<br>entered Rājagaha.</p>

<p id="p213"><span class="parno">213</span>The crossed over with the crossed over,
<br>with the former matted-hair ascetics,
<br>the well freed with the well freed,
<br>The Lord, beautifully coloured like a golden ornament,
<br>entered Rājagaha.</p>

<p id="p214"><span class="parno">214</span><span class="add">The existing with those who have existed [?]</span>
<br>with the former matted-hair ascetics,
<br>the well freed with the well freed,
<br>The Lord, beautifully coloured like a golden ornament,
<br>entered Rājagaha.</p>

<p id="p215"><span class="parno">215</span>He of the ten states,
<br>of the ten powers,
<br>versed in the ten things,
<br>and furnished with the ten,
<br>He, the Lord, surrounded by ten hundred,
<br>entered Rājagaha."</p>
</blockquote>

<p id="p216"><span class="parno">216</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.22.14"></a>People having seen Sakka, lord of the <i>devas</i>, spoke thus: "Indeed this brahman youth is lovely, indeed this brahman youth is good to look upon, indeed this brahman youth is<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.51"></a> charming. Whose, now, is this brahman youth?" When they had spoken thus, Sakka, lord of the <i>devas</i>, addressed these people with a verse:</p>

<hr>
<blockquote>
<p id="p217"><span class="parno">217</span>"He who is steadfast, tamed in every way,
<br>awakened, peerless among men,
<br>Perfected, well-farer,
<br>I am his attendant in the world."</p>
</blockquote>

<p id="p218"><span class="parno">218</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.22.15"></a>Then the Lord approached the dwelling of King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha; having approached he sat down on the appointed seat together with the Order of monks. Then King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha, with his own hand having offered, having satisfied the Order of monks with the awakened one at its head with sumptuous food, solid and soft, when the Lord had eaten and had withdrawn his hand from the bowl, sat down at a respectful distance.<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.39"></a></p>

<p>As he was sitting down at a respectful distance it occurred to King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha: "Now, where could the Lord stay that would be neither too far from a village nor too near, suitable for coming and going, accessible for people whenever they want, not crowded by day, having little noise at night, little sound, without folk’s breath, haunts of privacy, suitable for seclusion?"</p>

<p>Then it occurred to King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha: "Now, this Bamboo Grove of ours, a pleasure park, is neither too far from a village … suitable for seclusion. Suppose I were to give the Bamboo Grove, a pleasure park, to the Order of the monks with the awakened one at its head?"</p>

<p>Then King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha, having taken a ceremonial vessel made of gold, dedicated it to the Lord, saying: "May I, Lord, give this Bamboo Grove, a pleasure park, to the Order of monks with the awakened one at its head?" The Lord accepted the park. Then the Lord, having gladdened, rejoiced, roused, delighted King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha with talk on dhamma, having risen<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.52"></a> from his seat, departed. Then the Lord, on this occasion having given reasoned talk, addressed the monks, saying: "Monks, I allow a park."</p>

<p class="endsutta"><span class="parno">219</span>Told is the meeting with Bimbisāra</p>

<p id="p220"><span class="parno">220</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.23"></a><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.23.1"></a>At that time the wanderer Sañjaya was residing in Rājagaha together with a great company of wanderers, with two hundred and fifty wanderers. Now at that time Sāriputta and Moggallāna fared the Brahma-faring under the wanderer Sañjaya, and an agreement came to be formed by these: "Whoever attains the deathless first, let him announce it."</p>

<p id="p221"><span class="parno">221</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.23.2"></a>Then the venerable Assaji, having dressed in the morning, taking his bowl and robe, entered Rājagaha for almsfood. He was pleasing whether he was approaching or departing, whether he was looking in front or looking behind, whether he was drawing in or stretching out (his arm), his eyes were cast down, he was possessed of pleasant behaviour. The wanderer Sāriputta saw the venerable Assaji walking for almsfood in Rājagaha — pleasing whether he was approaching … possessed of pleasant behaviour — and seeing him, it occurred to him: "This is one of those monks who are indeed perfected ones in the world or who have entered on the way to perfection. What<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.40"></a> now if I, having approached this monk, should ask him: ‘On account of whom are you, your reverence, gone forth, or who is your teacher, or whose dhamma do you profess’?"</p>

<p>Then it occurred to the wanderer Sāriputta: "But it is not the right time to question this monk, he has gone in among the houses, he is walking for almsfood. What now if I should follow close after this monk who has learnt a way for those who need it?" Then the venerable Assaji, having walked<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.53"></a> for almsfood in Rājagaha, taking his almsbowl, returned. Then the wanderer Sāriputta approached the venerable Assaji; having approached, he exchanged greetings with the venerable Assaji; having exchanged courteous and friendly greetings, he stood at a respectful distance. As he was standing at a respectful distance, the wanderer Sāriputta spoke thus to the venerable Assaji: "Your reverence, your faculties are quite pure, your complexion very bright, very clear. On account of whom, your reverence, have you gone forth, or who is your teacher, or whose dhamma do you profess?"</p>

<p>"There is, friend, a great recluse, a son of the Sakyans, gone forth from a Sakyan family. I have gone forth on account of this Lord and this Lord is my teacher and I profess this Lord’s dhamma."</p>

<p>"But what is the doctrine of your reverence’s teacher, what does he point out?"</p>

<p>"Now, I, friend, am new, not long gone forth, fresh to this dhamma and discipline. I am not able to teach you dhamma in full, but I can tell you its purport briefly."</p>

<p>Then the wanderer Sāriputta spoke thus to the venerable Assaji: "So be it, your reverence,</p>

<p id="p222"><span class="parno">222</span>tell me little or tell me much, (but) in any case explain to me its purport; I want just its purport. Why should you make a great elaboration?"</p>

<p id="p223"><span class="parno">223</span>Then the venerable Assaji uttered this terse expression of dhamma to the wanderer Sāriputta:</p>

Then the wanderer Moggallāna saw the wanderer Sāriputta coming in the distance, and seeing<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.41"></a> the wanderer Sāriputta, he spoke thus: "Friend, your faculties are quite pure, your complexion very bright, very clear. Can it be that you, friend, have attained the deathless?"</p>

<p>"Yes, friend, I have attained the deathless."</p>

<p>"But how did you, friend, attain the deathless?"</p>

<hr>
<p>"Now, I, friend, saw the venerable Assaji walking for almsfood in Rājagaha — pleasing whether he was approaching or departing, whether he was looking in front or looking behind, whether he was drawing in or stretching out (his arm), his eyes were cast down, he was possessed of pleasant behaviour.

<p id="p251"><span class="parno">251</span>Now at that time monks, being without preceptors, not being exhorted, not being instructed, walked for almsfood wrongly dressed, wrongly clothed, not befittingly attired. While people were eating, they held their almsbowls close above the soft food for the remains, and they held their almsbowls close above the solid food for the remains, and they held their almsbowls close above the savoury food for the remains, and they held their almsbowls close above the beverages for the remains, and having themselves asked for curry and boiled rice, they ate it, and they remained in the refectory making a loud noise, a great noise.</p>

<p>People … spread it about, saying: "How can these recluses, sons of the Sakyans, walk for almsfood, wrongly dressed, wrongly clothed, not befittingly attired? While people are eating, they hold their almsbowls close above the<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.58"></a> soft food … and they remain in the refectory making a loud noise, a great noise, like brahmans at the meal-time of brahmans."</p>

<p id="p252"><span class="parno">252</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.25.3"></a>Monks heard these people who … spread it about. Those who were modest monks, contented, conscientious, scrupulous desirous of training … spread it about, saying: "How can these monks walk for almsfood wrongly dressed … and remain in the refectory making a loud noise, a great noise?"</p>

<p>Then these monks told this matter to the Lord.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p253"><span class="parno">253</span>Then the Lord, on this occasion, in this connection, having had the Order of monks convened, questioned the monks, saying: "Is it true, as is said, monks, that monks walk for almsfood wrongly dressed …<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.45"></a> … and remain in the refectory making a great noise, a loud noise?"</p>

<hr>
<p>"It is true, Lord."</p>

<p>The awakened one, the Lord rebuked them, saying:</p>

<p>"It is not fitting, monks, in these foolish men, it is not becoming, it is not proper, it is unworthy of a recluse, it is not allowable, it is not to be done. How, monks, can these foolish men walk for almsfood … and remain in the refectory making a loud noise, a great noise? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased, nor for increasing (the number of) those who are pleased, but it is, monks, for displeasing those who are not (yet) pleased as well as those who are pleased, and for causing wavering in some."</p>

<p>Then the Lord, having rebuked these monks, having in many a figure spoken in dispraise of difficulty in supporting and maintaining oneself, of great desires, of lack of contentment, of clinging (to the obstructions), of indolence; having in many a figure spoken in praise of ease in supporting and maintaining oneself, of desiring little, of contentment, of expunging (evil), of punctiliousness, of graciousness, of decreasing (the obstructions), of putting forth energy, having given reasoned talk on what is fitting, on what is becoming, addressed the monks, saying:</p>

Thus these, living with reverence, with deference, with courtesy towards one another, will come to growth, to increase, to maturity in this dhamma and discipline.</p>

<p>"And thus, monks, should a preceptor be chosen: having arranged the upper robe over one shoulder, having honoured his feet, having sat down on the haunches, having saluted with joined palms, he should speak to him thus: ‘Honoured sir, be my preceptor; honoured sir, be my preceptor; honoured sir, be my preceptor.’ If he says: ‘Very well’ or ‘Certainly’ or ‘All right’ or ‘It is proper’ or ‘Manage it amiably’, and makes this understood by gesture, makes this understood by speech, makes this understood by gesture and by speech, the preceptor has been chosen; if he does not make this understood by gesture, if he does not make this understood by speech,<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.46"></a> if he does not make this understood by gesture and by speech, the preceptor has not been chosen.</p>

Monks, if one who shares a cell is possessed of these five qualities, a preceptor, in not dismissing him, becomes one who has gone too far; in dismissing him he does not become one who has gone too far.</p>

<p id="p297"><span class="parno">297</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.28"></a><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.28.1"></a>Now at that time a certain brahman, having approached (some) monks, asked for the going forth. The monks did not want to let him go forth, and because he could not obtain the going forth among the monks, he became lean, wretched, of a bad colour, very yellow, his veins standing out all over his body. The Lord saw this brahman, lean … all over his body, and seeing him, he addressed the monks, saying: "How is it, monks, that this brahman is lean … all over his body?"</p>

<p>"Lord, this brahman asked the monks for the going forth. The monks did not want to let him go forth, and because he could not obtain the going forth among the monks, he is lean … all over his body."</p>

<p><a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.72"></a>Then the Lord addressed the monks, saying: "Now, monks, who remembers a service done by this brahman?" When he had spoken thus the venerable Sāriputta spoke thus to the Lord: "I, Lord, remember a service done by this brahman."</p>

<p>"Now, what help (given) by this brahman, Sāriputta, do you remember?"</p>

<p>"Lord, as I was walking for almsfood here in Rājagaha this brahman had spoon-alms bestowed upon me. This, Lord, is the service done by this brahman <a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.56"></a>which I remember."</p>

<p>"Good, Sāriputta, it is good. Indeed those who are truly men, Sāriputta, are thankful and grateful. Because of this do you, Sāriputta, let this brahman go forth (and) ordain him."</p>

<p>"How, lord, do I let this brahman go forth, how do I ordain him?"</p>

<hr>
<p id="p298"><span class="parno">298</span>Then the Lord, on this occasion, having given reasoned talk, addressed the monks, saying:</p>

<p>"From this day forth, monks, I abolish that ordination by going to the three refuges which I allowed. I allow you, monks, to ordain by a (formal) act consisting of a motion and a resolution put three times.</p>

<p>"And thus, monks, should one ordain: The Order should be informed by an experienced, competent monk, saying:</p>

Monks spoke thus: "Do not, your reverence, do that, it is not allowed." He spoke thus: "But indeed, I did not ask the venerable ones saying, ‘Ordain me’. Why did you ordain me without being asked (to do so)?" They told this matter to the Lord.<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.57"></a> He said:
<span class="rule">"Monks, you should not ordain without being asked (to do so). Whoever should (so) ordain, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span> I allow you, monks, to ordain when you have been asked (to do so).</p>

Then it occurred to a certain brahman: "Now, these recluses, sons of the Sakyans, are pleasant in character, pleasant in conduct; having eaten good meals they lie down on beds sheltered from the wind. What now if I should go forth among these recluses, sons of the Sakyans?" Then that brahman, having approached (some) monks, asked for the going forth. The monks allowed him to go forth (and) they ordained him.</p>

<p>The succession of meals dwindled away after he had gone forth. Monks spoke thus: "Come along now, your reverence, we will walk for almsfood." He spoke thus: "Your reverences, I did not go forth for this — that I should walk for almsfood. If you will give to me, I will eat, but if you will not give to me, I will leave the Order."</p>

<p>"But, did you, your reverence, go forth for your belly’s sake?" <a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.58"></a></p>

<p>"Yes, your reverences."</p>

<p>Those who were modest monks looked down upon, criticised, spread it about, saying: "How can this monk go forth in this dhamma and discipline which are well taught for his belly’s sake?"</p>

<hr>
<p id="p311"><span class="parno">311</span>These monks told this matter to the Lord. He said:</p>

<p>"Is it true, as is said, that you, monk, went forth for your belly’s sake?"</p>

<p>"It is true, Lord."</p>

<p>The enlightened one, the Lord rebuked him, saying:</p>

<p>"How can you, foolish man, go forth in this dhamma and discipline which are well taught for your belly’s sake? It is not foolish man, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased,<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.75"></a> nor for increasing (the number of) those who are pleased." Having rebuked him, having given reasoned talk, he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

<p>"I allow you, monks, when you are ordaining, to explain four resources: that going forth is on account of meals of scraps; in this respect effort is to be made by you for life. (These are) extra acquisitions: a meal for an Order, a meal for a special person, an invitation, ticket-food, (food given) on a day of the waxing or waning of the moon, on an Observance day, or the day after an Observance day. That going forth is on account of rag-robes; in this respect effort is to be made by you for life. (These are) extra acquisitions: (robes made of) linen, cotton, silk, wool, coarse hemp, canvas. That going forth is on account of a lodging at the root of a tree; in this respect effort is to be made by you for life. (These are) extra acquisitions: a dwelling-place, a curved house, a long house, a mansion, a cave. That going forth is on account of ammonia as a medicine; in this respect effort is to be made by you for life. (These are) extra acquisitions: ghee, fresh butter, oil, honey, molasses."</p>

<h4>&nbsp;</h4>

<p id="p313"><span class="parno">313</span>Now at that time a certain brahman youth, having approached <a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.76"></a>(some) monks, asked for the going forth. The monks explained the resources to him beforehand. He spoke thus: "If honoured sirs, you had explained the resources to me after I had gone forth, I should have been satisfied, but now, honoured sirs, I will not go forth; the resources are disgusting and loathsome to me." The monks told this matter to the Lord. He said:</p>

<p><span class="rule">"Monks, the resources should not be explained beforehand. Whoever should (thus) explain them, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span> <span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to explain the resources soon after ordaining (a person).</span>"</p>

<p id="p314"><span class="parno">314</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.31.2"></a>Now at that time monks ordained through a group of two and a group of three (monks). They told this matter to the Lord. He said:</p>

<p>"<span class="rule">Monks, you should not ordain through a group of less than ten (monks). Whoever should (so) ordain, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span> I allow you, monks, to ordain through a group of ten or more than ten (monks)."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p315"><span class="parno">315</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.31.3"></a>Now at that time monks of one year’s standing and of two years’ standing (severally) ordained the one who shared his cell. And when he was of one year’s standing, the venerable Upasena, Vanganta’s son, ordained the one who shared his cell. When he was of two years’ standing, having kept the rains-residence, taking the one who shared his cell and who was of one year’s standing, he approached the Lord. Having approached, having greeted the Lord, he sat down at a respectful distance. Now, it is the custom for awakened ones, for Lords to exchange friendly greetings with in-coming monks.</p>

<p>Then the Lord spoke thus to the venerable Upasena, Vanganta’s son: "I hope, monk, that things go well with you, I hope you are keeping going, I hope you came here with but little fatigue on the journey."</p>

<p>"Things do go well with me, Lord, I am keeping going, <a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.77"></a>Lord, I came, Lord, with but little fatigue on the journey."</p>

<p>Now, Truthfinders (sometimes) ask knowing, and knowing (sometimes) do not ask; they ask, knowing the right time (to ask), and they do not ask, knowing the right time (when not to ask). Truthfinders ask about what belongs to the goal, not about what does not belong to the goal. There is bridge-breaking, for Truthfinders in whatever does not belong to the goal. Awakened ones, Lords, question monks concerning two matters: "Shall we teach dhamma?" or "Shall we lay down a rule of training for disciples?"</p>

<p>Then the Lord spoke thus to the venerable Upasena, Vanganta’s son: "Of how many years’ standing are you, monk?"</p>

<hr>
<p>"I, Lord, am of two years’ standing."</p>

<p>"And of how many years’ standing is this monk?"</p>

<p>"He is of one year’s standing, Lord."</p>

<p>"Who is this monk as regards you?"</p>

<p>"He is the one who shares my cell, Lord."</p>

<p>The awakened one, the Lord rebuked (him), saying:</p>

<p>"It is not fitting, foolish man, it is not becoming, it is not proper, it is unworthy of a recluse, it is not allowable, it should not be done. How can you, foolish man, when you should be exhorted and instructed by others, think to exhort and instruct another (monk)? Too quickly have you, foolish man, turned to abundance, that is to say to acquiring a group. It is not, foolish man, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased, nor for increasing (the number of) those who are pleased." Having rebuked him, having given reasoned talk, he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

<p>"<span class="rule">Monks, one who is of less than ten years’ standing should not ordain. Whoever (such) should (so) ordain, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span><span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to ordain through one who is of ten years’ standing or through one who is of more than ten years’ standing.</span>"</p>

<p id="p316"><span class="parno">316</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.31.6"></a><a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.78"></a>Now at that time ignorant, inexperienced monks ordained thinking: "We are of ten years’ standing, we are of ten years’ standing." (Consequently) there were to be found ignorant preceptors, wise (monks) who shared their cells; inexperienced preceptors, experienced (monks) who shared their cells; preceptors who had heard little, (monks) who shared their cells who had heard much; preceptors of poor intelligence,<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.60"></a> intelligent (monks) who shared their cells; and a certain former member of another sect, when he was being spoken to by his preceptor regarding a rule, having refuted the preceptor, went over to the fold of that same sect.</p>

<p>Those who were modest monks … spread it about, saying: "How can these ignorant, inexperienced monks ordain, thinking: ‘We are of ten years’ standing, we are of ten years’ standing’? (So that) there are to be found … intelligent (monks) who share their cells." Then these monks told this matter to the Lord.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p317"><span class="parno">317</span>He said:</p>

<p>Then awakened one, the Lord rebuked them, saying:</p>

<p>"How, monks, can these foolish men, ignorant, inexperienced, ordain, thinking: ‘We are of ten years’ standing, we are of ten years’ standing’? … intelligent (monks) who share their cells. It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … " And having rebuked them, having given reasoned talk, he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

<p id="p318"><span class="parno">318</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.32"></a><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.32.1"></a>Now at that time monks, when their preceptors had gone away and had left the Order and had died and had gone over to another side (of the Order), being without<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.79"></a> teachers, not being exhorted, not being instructed, walked for almsfood wrongly dressed, wrongly clothed, not befittingly attired. While people were eating, they held their almsbowls close above the soft food for the remains, and they held their almsbowls close above the solid food for the remains, and they held their almsbowls close above the savoury food for the remains, and they held their almsbowls close above the beverages for the remains, and having themselves asked for curry and boiled rice, they ate it, and they remained in the refectory making a loud noise, a great noise.</p>

<p>People … spread it about, saying: "How can these recluses, sons of the Sakyans, walk for almsfood, wrongly dressed, wrongly clothed, not befittingly attired? While people are eating, they hold their almsbowls close above the soft food … and they remain in the refectory making a loud noise, a great noise, like brahmans at the meal-time of brahmans."</p>

<hr>
<p>Monks heard these people who … spread it about. Those who were modest monks, contented, conscientious, scrupulous desirous of training … spread it about, saying: "How can these monks walk for almsfood wrongly dressed … and remain in the refectory making a loud noise, a great noise?"</p>

<hr>
<p>Then these monks told this matter to the Lord.</p>

<hr>
<p>Then the Lord, on this occasion, in this connection, having had the Order of monks convened, questioned the monks, saying: "Is it true, as is said, monks, that monks walk for almsfood wrongly dressed … and remain in the refectory making a great noise, a loud noise?"</p>

<hr>
<p>"It is true, Lord."</p>

<p>Having rebuked them, having given reasoned talk, he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

<hr>
<p id="p319"><span class="parno">319</span>"Monks, I allow a teacher. The teacher, monks, should arouse in his pupil the attitude of a son; the pupil should arouse in his teacher the attitude of a father. Thus these, living with reverence, with deference, with courtesy towards one another, will come to growth, increase, maturity in this dhamma and discipline. I allow you, monks, to live ten years in dependence, and when one is of ten years’ standing to give guidance.</p>

<p><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.32.2"></a>"And thus, monks, should a teacher be chosen: having arranged the upper robe over one shoulder, having honoured his feet, having sat down on the haunches, having saluted with joined palms, he should speak to him thus:

If he says: ‘Very well’ or ‘Certainly’ or ‘All right’ or ‘It is proper’ or ‘Manage it amiably’, and makes this understood by gesture, makes this understood by speech, makes this understood by gesture and by speech, the teacher has been chosen; if he does not make this understood by gesture, if he does not make this understood by speech, if he does not make this understood by gesture and by speech, the teacher has not been chosen.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p320"><span class="parno">320</span>"The pupil, monks, should conduct himself properly towards his preceptor. This is the proper conduct in this respect:</p>

<p id="p321"><span class="parno">321</span>Having got up early, having taken off his sandals, having arranged his upper robe over one shoulder, he should give tooth-wood, he should give water for rinsing the mouth, he should make ready a seat. If there is conjey, having washed a bowl, the conjey should be placed near (the preceptor). When he has drunk the conjey, having given him water, having received the bowl, having lowered it, having washed it properly without rubbing it, it should be put away. When the preceptor has got up, the seat should be removed. If that place is soiled, that place should be swept.</p>

<p id="p322"><span class="parno">322</span>"If the preceptor wishes to enter a village, his inner clothing should be given (to him), the inner clothing (that he is wearing) should be received (from him) in return, the girdle should be given (to him); having folded them (into two or four folds), the outer robes are to be given (to him); having washed it, a bowl with water is to be given (to him). If the preceptor desires an attendant, (the latter) having put on his inner robe all round so as to cover the three circles, having bound on the girdle, having folded them and having dressed in the outer robes, having fastened the ties, having washed, having taken a bowl, should be the preceptor’s attendant. He should not walk too far away (from him), he should not walk too close. He should receive the bowl and its contents.</p>

<p>"He should not interrupt the preceptor when he is speaking. (But) if the preceptor is bordering on an offence, then speaking himself, he should warn him.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p323"><span class="parno">323</span>When he is returning, he should make a seat ready, having come back first; he should set out water for washing the feet, a foot-stool, a foot-stand; having gone to meet him, he should receive his bowl and robe, he should give back the inner clothing (given) in return, he should receive his inner clothing. If a robe is damp with perspiration, he should dry it for a short time in the sun’s warmth, but a robe should not be laid aside in the warmth. He should fold up the robe. When folding up the robe, having made the corners turn back four finger-breadths, he should fold up the robe thinking: ‘Mind there is no crease in the middle.’ The girdle should be placed in a fold (of the robe).</p>

<p id="p324"><span class="parno">324</span>If there comes to be almsfood and the preceptor wishes to eat, having given him water, almsfood should be placed near (him).

He should lay aside the bowl and robes. When laying aside the bowl, having taken the bowl in one hand, having felt with the other hand under the couch or under the chair, the bowl should be laid aside, but the bowl should not be laid aside on the bare ground. When laying aside a robe, having taken the robe in one hand, having stroked the other hand along the bamboo for robes or the cord for robes, having got the edges away from him and the fold towards him, the robe should be laid aside. When the preceptor has got up, the seat should be removed, the water for washing the feet, the foot-stool, the foot-stand should be put away.

<p id="p325"><span class="parno">325</span>"If the preceptor wishes to bathe, he should prepare a bath. If he wants a cold (bath), he should prepare a cold one; if he wants a hot (bath), he should prepare a hot one.</p>

<p id="p328"><span class="parno">328</span>In whatever dwelling-place the preceptor is staying, if that dwelling-place is soiled, it should be cleaned if he is able (to do so).

Having taken out the reclining-board, he should lay it to one side. Having taken out the ground-covering, having observed how it was laid down, he should lay it to one side.

If a wall that was coloured red becomes stained, he should wipe it, having moistened a rag, having wrung it out. If ground that was blacked becomes stained he should wipe it, having moistened a rag, having wrung it out. If the ground did not come to be treated, he should sweep it, having sprinkled it all over with water, thinking: ‘Take care lest the dwelling-place is sullied with dust.’ Having looked for (any) rubbish, he should remove it to one side.</p>

<p>"But I, masters, am very busy, there is much to be done, and King <a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.72"></a>Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha is to be looked after by me, also the women’s quarters and the Order of monks with the awakened one at its head. I am not able to attend you."</p>

<p>"All this property shall become yours, teacher, and we will be your slaves. It were good, teacher, if you would attend us."</p>

Suppose we were to go forth among the recluses, sons of the Sakyans? In that case monks would look after us and moreover Jīvaka Komārabhacca would attend us." Then these people, having approached (some) monks, asked for the going forth. The monks let them go forth, they ordained them.

<p>Now at that time monks, looking after many ill monks, lived intent on asking, intent on hinting, saying: "Give food for the sick, give food for those who look after the sick, give medicines for the sick."

Then it occurred to this descendant … in the world: "Now these recluses, sons of the Sakyans, are of pleasant conduct, of pleasant character; having eaten good meals, they lie down to sleep on beds sheltered from the wind. Suppose that I, having prepared a bowl and robe for myself, having cut off my hair and beard, having clothed myself in yellow robes, having gone to a monastery, should be in communion together with monks?"</p>

<p>Then that descendant … in the world, having prepared a bowl and robe for himself, having cut off his hair and beard, having clothed himself in yellow robes, having gone to a monastery, greeted the monks. The monks spoke thus:</p>

<p>"Of how many years’ standing are you, your reverence?"</p>

<p>"What does this mean, your reverences: ‘how many years’ standing’?"</p>

<p>"But who, your reverence, is your preceptor?"</p>

<p>"What does this mean, your reverences: ‘preceptor’?"</p>

<p>The monks spoke thus to the venerable Upāli:</p>

<p>"Please, reverend Upāli, examine this one who has gone forth."</p>

<p><a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.110"></a>Then as that descendant … in the world was being examined by the venerable Upāli, he told him this matter. The venerable Upāli told this matter to the monks. The monks told this matter to the Lord. He said:</p>

<p>"<span class="rule">Monks, if one who is in communion by theft is not ordained, he should not be ordained; if he is ordained, he should be expelled.

Then it occurred to that serpent: "These recluses, sons of the Sakyans, are dhamma-farers, even-farers, Brahma-farers, they are truth-speakers, they are of moral habit, of good conduct. Now if I were to go forth among the recluses, sons of the Sakyans, so would I be freed quickly from birth as a serpent and could get back human status."</p>

<p>Then that serpent, in the form of a brahman youth, having approached the monks, asked for the going forth. The monks let him go forth, they ordained him. Now at that time that serpent, together with a certain monk, was living in a dwelling-place on the boundary. Then that monk, getting up in the night towards dawn, paced up and down in the open air. Then that serpent, confident that that monk had gone out, fell asleep. The whole dwelling-place was full of the snake, his coils were protruding through the windows.</p>

<p>Then that monk, thinking: "I will enter the dwelling-place," opening the door, saw the whole dwelling-place full of the snake, his coils protruding through the windows. Terrified at seeing this, he uttered a cry of distress. Monks, having run up, spoke thus to that monk: "Why did you, your reverence, utter a cry of distress?"</p>

<p>"Your reverences, this whole dwelling-place is full of a snake, his coils are protruding through the windows." Then that serpent having awakened because of this noise, sat down on his own seat. Monks spoke thus: "Who are you, friend?"</p>

<p>"I am a serpent, honoured sirs."</p>

<p>"But why did you, friend, act in this way?" Then that serpent told this matter to the monks. The monks told this matter to the Lord.</p>

<p id="p485"><span class="parno">485</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.63.4"></a>Then the Lord on this occasion, in this connection, having had the Order of monks convened, spoke thus to this serpent: "Indeed, you serpents are not liable to growth in this dhamma and discipline. You, serpent, go away, observe the Observance day precisely on the fourteenth, fifteenth and eighth day of the half-month. Thus will you be freed quickly from birth as a serpent and get back human status."</p>

<p>Then that serpent, thinking: "It is said that I am not liable to growth in this dhamma and discipline," pained, afflicted, shedding tears, departed having uttered a cry of distress.</p>

<p>Then the Lord addressed the monks, saying: "Monks, there are these two cases of manifestation of a serpent’s true nature: when he indulges in sexual intercourse with a female of his own species, and when he falls asleep in confidence. Monks, these are two cases<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.88"></a> of manifestation of a serpent’s true nature. <span class="rule">Monks, if an animal is not ordained, it should not be ordained; if it is ordained, it should be expelled.</span>"</p>

<h4>&nbsp;</h4>

<p id="p539"><span class="parno">539</span>Now at that time monks, having ordained a certain monk, went away leaving him alone. Afterwards as he was going along alone, he met his former wife on the way. She spoke thus: "What, have you now gone forth?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I have gone forth." She said:</p>

<hr>
<p>"Sexual intercourse is difficult for those who have gone forth. Come and indulge in sexual intercourse." Having indulged in sexual intercourse with her, he arrived late. Monks spoke thus: "What were you, your reverence, doing for such a long time?"</p>

<p>Then this monk told this matter to the monks. The monks told this matter to the Lord. He said:</p>

<p>"<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, having ordained (a monk), to give him a companion and to explain four things which are not to be done.</span></p>

<p id="p540"><span class="parno">540</span>When a monk is ordained he should not indulge in sexual intercourse, even with an animal. Whatever monk indulges in sexual intercourse, he becomes not a (true) recluse, not a son of the Sakyans. As a man with his head cut off could not become one to live by that bodily connection, even so a monk, having indulged in sexual intercourse, becomes not a (true) recluse, not a son of the Sakyans. This is a thing not to be done by you as long as life lasts.</p>

<p id="p541"><span class="parno">541</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.78.3"></a>"When a monk is ordained he should not take by theft what has not been given, even if it is only a blade of grass. Whatever monk takes by theft a <i>pāda</i> or the worth of a <i>pāda</i> or more than a <i>pāda</i> that has not been given, he becomes not<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.125"></a> a (true) recluse, not a son of the Sakyans. As a withered leaf, freed from its stalk, could not become green again, even so a monk, having taken by theft a <i>pāda</i> or the worth of a <i>pāda</i> or more than a <i>pāda</i> that was not given, becomes not a (true) recluse, not a son of the Sakyans. This<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.97"></a> is a thing not to be done by you as long as life lasts.</p>

<p id="p542"><span class="parno">542</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.78.4"></a>"When a monk is ordained he should not intentionally deprive a living thing of life, even if it is only an ant. Whatever monk deprives a human being of life even down to causing abortion, he becomes not a (true) recluse, not a son of the Sakyans. As a flat stone, broken in half, becomes (something) not to be put together again, even so a monk, having intentionally deprived a human being of life, becomes not a (true) recluse, not a son of the Sakyans. This is a thing not to be done by you as long as life lasts.</p>

<p id="p543"><span class="parno">543</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.78.5"></a>"When a monk is ordained he should not lay claim to a state of further-men, even thinking: ‘I delight in solitude’. Whatever monk, of evil desires, filled with covetousness, lays claim to a state of further-men which is non-existent, not a fact — to meditation or to a deliverance or to contemplation or to an attainment or to a way or to a fruit — he becomes not a (true) recluse, not a son of the Sakyans. As a palmyra palm, cut off at the crown, could not become one for further growth, even so a monk, of evil desires, filled with covetousness, having claimed a state of further-men which is nonexistent, not a fact, becomes not a (true) recluse, not a son of the Sakyans. This is a thing not to be done by you as long as life lasts."</p>
